Millions of people have been touched, inspired, and encouraged by this story of a World War II waif in Warsaw, Poland. As a 10-year-old Jewish boy, Zvi was separated from his parents and forced to face the trials of survival in Adolph Hitler&#39;s crazed world. How he triumphed against all odds and found his way to Israel and faith in the Messiah is one of the greatest stories of our time. Now ZVI and the sequel, ZVI and the Next Generation, are combined in a new book, ZVI: The Miraculous Story of Triumph Over the Holocaust. The whole story -- together at last and updated with new information that will thrill your heart.

As a boy he did crazy things like climbing atop a burning roof and picking a fight with the town constable. As a soldier, he was even more reckless. He was obsessed with being the leader and the hero in every battle, and he never wanted to surrender. He even killed his own horse once rather than give it to the enemy.<br>&nbsp;<br>Where did the extremism lead Arnold?

As teachers strive to help all students reach their full potential, the needs of English language learners (ELLs) can seem overwhelming. In this book, educators and consultants P�rsida and William Himmele present a five-part, research-based framework--CHATS--that teachers can use to help ELLs, as well as other students, attain greater language skills and deeper content comprehension. This field-tested framework includes diagnostic tools, comprehensive overviews on second-language acquisition, and teaching techniques to boost language learning in any classroom. The CHATS framework provides teachers with Content reading strategies, Higher-order thinking skills, Assessment tools, Total participation techniques, and Scaffolding strategies. The book also contains helpful planning worksheets, assessment logs, and scaffolding tools. Teachers will also find more than 25 classroom and team-building activities and specific tips about how these activities benefit ELLs. This book is an invaluable resource that will help teachers foster greater gains in students language development, increase their comprehension across all subject areas, and build classrooms that are engaging and welcoming to students of all cultures.</p><p></p><h2>The Perspectives of Psychiatry</h2><p><p>Substantially revised to include a wealth of new material, the second edition of this highly acclaimed work provides a concise, coherent introduction that brings structure to an increasingly fragmented and amorphous discipline. Paul R. McHugh and Phillip R. Slavney offer an approach that emphasizes psychiatry's unifying concepts while accommodating its diversity. Recognizing that there may never be a single, all-encompassing theory, the book distills psychiatric practice into four explanatory methods: diseases, dimensions of personality, goal-directed behaviors, and life stories. These perspectives, argue the authors, underlie the principles and practice of all psychiatry. With an understanding of these fundamental methods, readers will be equipped to organize and evaluate psychiatric information and to develop a confident approach to practice and research.</p></p><p>Now in paperback, this highly acclaimed work provides a concise, coherent introduction to an increasingly fragmented discipline.

All three were West Pointers who pursued their army careers with a remarkable zeal, even as their paths diverged. Bradley was a standout infantry instructor, while Eisenhower displayed an unusual ability for organization and diplomacy. Patton, who had chased Pancho Villa in Mexico and led troops in the First World War, seemed destined for high command and outranked his two friends for years. But with the arrival of World War II, it was Eisenhower who attained the role of Supreme Commander, with Patton and Bradley as his subordinates.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jonathan W. Jordan&#x2019;s <i>New York Times</i> bestselling <i>Brothers Rivals Victors</i> explores this friendship that waxed and waned over three decades and two world wars, a union complicated by rank, ambition, jealousy, backbiting and the enormous stresses of command. In a story that unfolds across the deserts of North Africa to the beaches of Sicily, from D-Day to the Battle of the Bulge and beyond, readers are offered revealing new portraits of these iconic generals.</p><p><b>Jonathan W.

For a second, she felt a chill on the back of her neck, but then the sparrows flew off to do sparrow business and she realized she was being paranoid. Just because the city's birds had gone all creepy and otherworldly once didn't mean every sparrow was a harbinger.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes a bird was just a bird.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She returned to her Scrabble death match with Vivek.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ten minutes later, the two of them were taking an insane amount of pleasure in arguing over a word when Sara called to ask her to track a young vampire who thought he could skip out on his Contract. "Why?" she said to both Sara and Vivek, after putting the conversation on speaker.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Because you're a Guild Hunter, and we find and haul back runaway vampires," was Sara's dry response. "If you don't know that by now, Ellie, there's no hope for you."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"No." Elena leaned back in her chair across from Vivek. "Why do a certain percentage of baby vamps think that (a) all the nasty, terrible things they've heard about the old angels aren't true, and (b)-after discovering that, in fact, all the previous knowledge they had is true, why do they think they'll be the one wet-behind-the-ears idiot who'll make it to freedom?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Both of those things made zero sense to Elena. You'd have to be blind, deaf, and mentally unhinged not to realize that angelkind was not human in any way, shape, or form. To a being who had lived a thousand years, what were mortals and new-Made vampires but bugs to be crushed? Nothing but fragile fireflies. Pretty perhaps, if your tastes ran that way, but gone and forgotten in mere heartbeats.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That Elena was now the consort of the most powerful immortal in North America didn't change her bone-deep understanding of that searing truth. Raphael was learning to act with more humanity because of the bond of love that tied them together, but he wasn't human, and he never would be; it'd be like asking a ferocious tiger to turn tame. An impossibility-and a destruction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Raphael was a glorious fury, a power.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Elena was a newborn angel with a heart that would always be mortal, even should she live ten thousand years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I have an answer." Vivek raised his hand, his sharply handsome face bearing a cheek-creasing grin, and the rich brown of his skin lit with good humor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It had been a long time since Elena had seen any sign of the petulance and pettiness that had once been as much a part of him as his striking intellect. Then, Vivek had controlled the Cellars, the hidey-hole the Guild kept for hunters who needed to lie low for a while-such as a wayward hunter who might've slit the throat of a vampire so brutally powerful he was an archangel's second.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Elena still wasn't sorry about that. Dmitri had deserved to feel the lethal edge of her knife and more. And it wasn't as if he'd been at any risk of dying. The arrogant fuck had blown her a kiss while his shirt was wet with darkest crimson, the blood loss nothing to a vampire that strong.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Not that his lack of injuries and twisted delight in the violent interaction had stopped him from stalking Elena-hence her need to disappear into the Cellars. In that underground world, Vivek had been king, and he'd relished his power. Piss him off and you'd say good-bye to air-conditioning, your room a sauna-and forget about fresh coffee. These days, however, the Cellars were someone else's domain; and, like her, Vivek was growing into a strange new skin.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the five years since he'd been Made a vampire, the formerly tetraplegic guild hunter had regained the use of his arms and most of his upper body. Even though his lower body remained numb to sensation and offered no way for him to get out of the wheelchair he'd been in since childhood, Vivek wasn't complaining.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The healers had predicted it would take decades for him to regain even basic movement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Enlighten us," Sara said in response to Vivek's declaration, her tone distinctly amused. Whispers coming through the line told Elena her best friend was clearing paperwork while she spoke to them; the Guild director's job was never finished.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"The transition to vampirism," Vivek said in an ostentatiously pompous tone, "causes a reaction in a small percentage of vampires that turns on the idiot gene." He held up a finger in a "pay attention" stance. "Said gene is located on chromosome pair twenty-four, colloquially known as the vampire chromosome."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Elena nodded with equal solemnity. "An intriguing hypothesis, Professor Kapur. Perhaps you should apply for a VPA research grant."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As Vivek cracked up at her reference to the Vampire Protection Authority-which seemed to exist to slap guild hunters with "excessive force" violations, usually while the hunters were still bleeding from vampire bites and clawings-Sara said, "If you two comedians are finished, I need you to haul ass, Ellie. Angel involved is very senior and very angry. Name's Imani."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Elena could've resigned from the Guild years ago. Being Consort to the Archangel of New York tended to tie up a woman's time. But she'd clung to the Guild with her fingernails, being a hunter as much a part of her psyche as breathing. Even more so because she was hunter-born: a bloodhound with the capacity to track vampires by scent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rusted oak, champagne, sugar mixed with camphor, a cascade of flowers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just four scents among the millions in the world. Her brain had the capacity to narrow down a particular scent to a particular vampire. Vivek, for example, was cold and fresh river water and a vivid burst of aquamarine shards. She knew the latter wasn't a scent, but it was the only way she'd found to describe what she picked up around her friend.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As for the angel-tracking ability she'd begun to develop after waking as an angel, that remained erratic at best and nonexistent at worst.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I know Imani," she said to Sara.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I was hoping you'd say that. She's . . . touchy."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That was one word for the angel in question. "I'll calm her down."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I've sent the details to your phone. You want a necklet?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"No, I'll be fine." No point detouring to Guild HQ for the vampire immobilization device when she already had the advantage of wings as well as a droplet of immortal strength. Not much. Laughable when compared to angelkind, but she was now much harder to hurt than any other hunter in the Guild. "If I can't haul back a runner on my own, I need to be put in Guild remedial school."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As Vivek grinned, Sara said, "Come by tonight for a coffee. I want to talk to you about something."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'll be there." Hanging up, Elena pointed a finger at Vivek. "I do not withdraw my challenge about your most recently created word."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Your funeral." Vivek had on his Scrabble poker face. "I'll save the game to continue the next time you're in." A beep sounded behind him in the surveillance control center.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Turning his wheelchair around using his hands, he went to check on the alert. After much anguish, he'd retired his previous high-tech and networked electronic chair-the manual chair gave him a way to exercise his upper body without having to spend even longer with the physiotherapists. He'd bulked up considerably in the past couple of years, his shoulders strong and his arm muscles defined.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Ellie, hey, wait." He flicked up an image onto one of his many screens. "Signs of seismic activity out by the Catskills."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Shit." She stared at the jagged lines that danced across the screen, her stomach suddenly in knots and images of the sparrows blazing to the forefront of her mind. One word loomed large in her thoughts: Cascade.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A confluence of time and unknown critical events that had ignited a power surge in the archangels who ruled the world, with a side-helping of random cataclysmic occurrences, the Cascade had demonstrated a tendency to spike then flatline as it built toward an endgame none of them could predict. It had been two and a half years since the last resurgence-back during her and Raphael's trip to Morocco-and she'd been hoping the damn thing would go from dormant to stone dead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Elena was sick of fucking zombies, impossible diseases that struck angels from the sky, and storms and quakes that left scars in the earth. Oh, and let's not forget the Hudson turning crimson, as if the city was bleeding. That had been just lovely. "How bad?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Too deep and too weak for humans to feel. And it looks like I have a report from the seismic people at the university." He read the e-mail. "Movement tagged as standard settling of the land. Only picked up because they're testing the super-sensitive new equipment the Tower helped finance."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Stomach unknotting, Elena blew out a quiet breath. No Cascade-linked insanity, then. No need to put on her tinfoil hat and start yelling about the end of the world. Just a tiny-normal-tremor deep in the earth. "Ping me if you get any more alerts, and make sure Dmitri knows too. I better get going on this hunt."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Vivek swiveled his wheelchair around. "Happy hunting." In his eyes, dark and intense, lived a feral hunger. It was as if his transition to vampirism had splintered more than two decades of grim-willed control.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Because Vivek, too, was hunter-born, the hunt in his blood.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That he hadn't gone mad long ago was a testament to his incredible resolve. Elena had used him as backup on two recent jobs where he could situate himself on a rooftop and cover her using a sniper's rifle. A number of other hunters had pulled him in the same way. For now, that seemed to be enough to take the edge off. "You, too," she said with a nod at his control center. "Say hi to your man-crush for me."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A raised middle finger before he turned back to the screens that flowed with data. "Come back when you're ready to get massacred on the Scrabble board."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Leaving the Tower's tech hub with a final "You made up that word!"-to which Vivek called out, "Illiterate Luddite!"-she read the details of the job on her way to her and Raphael's Tower suite. All she had on her were knives, and she liked to take a weapon with distance reach when on a retrieval.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Droplet of immortal strength or not, arrogance was a good way to get dead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just last week, Ransom had barely escaped being disemboweled by an aggressive vampire's disgusting dirty claws. Some people had no sense of good hygiene. As it was, Ransom's treasured leather jacket hadn't escaped the attempted mauling unscathed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He'd still be sulking over it if his wife hadn't managed to source a near-identical jacket from who-knew-where: Librarians obviously had stellar research skills. And librarians married to guild hunters had nerves of steel. Per Ransom, his wife had told him to hose himself clean of the vampire blood before he set foot in their home.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Demarco had snorted when Ransom relayed that story, the shaggy blond of his hair in serious need of a cut. "I wouldn't obey my wife's orders like that-you gotta be the man in the relationship, wear the pants."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Sure," Ransom had drawled, unperturbed. "I'll pass your words of wisdom on to Nyree the next time she talks about inviting your sorry ass over for dinner. Enjoy the moldy bread in your fridge."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Laughing at the memory of how Demarco had clutched at his heart and fallen off his chair, Elena entered the suite. She grabbed her crossbow first and strapped it to her left thigh. Lightweight, with the extra bolts carried in a new flat quiver she would strap to her other thigh, she treasured and babied it like it was "her precious."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ransom's words.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Also true.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She decided against a gun; she kept up her training, but the crossbow combined with blades was more her thing. Today, she slid a long blade into the sheath that ran down her back. The near-white of her hair was already in a tight braid, and she had her heavy-duty hunting knife in her boot, so all that was left for her to do was check that the knives she wore in her forearm sheaths were all snugly slotted in, and she was done.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Striding across the thick carpet of the living area, she opened the doors that led out to a railingless balcony and stepped into the crisp white of a winter's day.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The cold slapped her. Hard.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She gritted her teeth, grateful for her long-sleeved thermal black top. It had been designed especially for her, to provide a measure of protection at high altitudes. She had nowhere near ordinary angelic levels of cold toleration. The squadron with whom Raphael had gone out in the pre-dawn darkness were probably in sleeveless tunics.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Her teeth threatened to chatter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Screw looking tough," she said to the disinterested pigeon that had stopped on the balcony. "I'd rather be warm." Going back inside, she pulled on a form-fitting black jacket designed with slits for her wings, and fancy straps that held it tight to her body. Then she tugged on gloves for good measure-after first moving the forearm knife sheaths on top of the jacket sleeves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Okay, now I'm ready."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Shutting the balcony doors behind herself, because she had no desire to return to an arctic environment, she took a moment to enjoy the glittering spectacle of New York gearing up for the day after a long, cold night, then fell off the edge of the balcony, her wings spreading behind her in a snap of strength. Those wings were an extraordinary blend of colors, beginning as pure black on the inner curve, then flowing into indigo, deepest blue, and the whispered shade of dawn.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Her primaries were a shimmering white-gold.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beautiful wings, but they could've been dishwater brown and she'd have loved them as much, for they took her to the skies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The air was razored glass in her lungs, it was so cold, but a cool yellow sun rode the sky today. The distant star wasn't strong enough to melt the snow that blanketed the city, but it made that snow ignite with light and turned the ice that dripped off the edges of buildings into iridescent diamonds.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beneath her, the Legion building lay draped in pristine white.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The greenery that covered its outsides in spring and summer slept under winter's kiss, but Elena knew that should she fly inside, she'd be met with a blast of heat and the rich, earthy humidity of growing things. Green was the color of the Legion building on the inside-living green.</p></p><h2>Perfectly Reasonable Deviations from the Beaten Track</h2><p>A Nobel Prize-winning physicist, a loving husband and father, an enthusiastic teacher, a surprisingly accomplished bongo player, and a genius of the highest caliber---Richard P. Feynman was all these and more. <i>Perfectly Reasonable Deviations From the Beaten Track</i>--collecting over forty years' worth of Feynman's letters--offers an unprecedented look at the writer and thinker whose scientific mind and lust for life made him a legend in his own time. Containing missives to and from such scientific luminaries as Victor Weisskopf, Stephen Wolfram, James Watson, and Edward Teller, as well as a remarkable selection of letters to and from fans, students, family, and people from around the world eager for Feynman's advice and counsel, <i>Perfectly Reasonable Deviations From the Beaten Track</i> not only illuminates the personal relationships that underwrote the key developments in modern science, but also forms the most intimate look at Feynman yet available. Feynman was a man many felt close to but few really knew, and this collection reveals the full wisdom and private passion of a personality that captivated everyone it touched. <i>Perfectly Reasonable Deviations From the Beaten Track</i> is an eloquent testimony to the virtue of approaching the world with an inquiring eye; it demonstrates the full extent of the Feynman legacy like never before. Edited and with additional commentary by his daughter Michelle, it's a must-read for Feynman fans everywhere, and for anyone seeking to better understand one of the towering figures--and defining personalities--of the twentieth century.</p><p>Finding out about someone by reading their correspondence is a fundamentally different thing than reading their biography. Letters offer both more intimacy with the subject and at the same time a crucial distance--the exact distance the letter-writer intended from the people to whom he was writing. In <i>Perfectly Reasonable Deviations from the Beaten Track</i>, Michelle Feynman collects her famous father's letters to reveal a warm, honest man with high expectations for himself, his loved ones, and the human race. Long before Richard Feynman won the Nobel Prize, he was a smart, skinny graduate student at Princeton, writing letters to his mother and relating the mundane details of college life. "Dear Mom.... The raincoat came O.K. It is very nice," he writes. By the time he finished his Ph.D., Feynman had fallen for Arline Greenbaum, who had already been diagnosed with tuberculosis. Their tragically short marriage is set in letters against Feynman's first job--working on the atomic bomb project at Los Alamos, New Mexico. <p> Even while working on top secret physics, Feynman was an enthusiastic correspondent, jumping eagerly at the chance to encourage a young scientist, correct a public misperception, or tell a goofy joke to his family. Self-effacing, charmingly down to earth, and occasionally cranky, these letters cover Feynman's entire career, although in the fits and starts one would expect from a collection such as this. His own words to students, spouses, daughters, and fellow scientists reveal Feynman's brilliance far more effectively than any biographical lens ever could. <i>--Therese Littleton</i></p><b>Richard P. Feynman</b> was raised in Far Rockaway, New York, and received his Ph.D. from Princeton. He held professorships at both Cornell and the California Institute of Technology. In 1965 he received the Nobel Prize for his work on quantum electrodynamics. He died in 1988.</p><h2>Haphazard by Starlight: A Poem A Day From Advent To Epiphany</h2><p>Unlike Lent, Advent is celebrated when the year is becoming darker and colder, moving into the death and dormancy of winter.

Sterba, Professor of Philosophy, Fellow of the Institute for International Peace Studies, University of Notre Dame <p>MOST EXTENSIVE READER AVAILABLE "This is the most extensive, and far reaching, reader available covering theoretical issues connected with human rights. In Part One, Hayden offers substantial excerpts from the Western tradition of political theory from Plato and Aristotle through Marx and Mill; major contemporary philosophical works by authors ranging from Hart, Cranston, and Feinberg to Nussbaum, Rorty, and Derrida; and a good selection of non-Western sources. That alone would make a fine book. But Part Two provides another three hundred pages of thoughtful theoretical discussions of contemporary issues including relativism, group rights, humanitarian intervention, women's rights, gays and lesbians, and the environment.

But I am going to miss you all damnably.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You will be c-counting your blessings, George,&#x201d; said Flavian Arnott, Viscount Ponsonby, &#x201c;as soon as you realize you will not have to listen to Vince scraping away on his v-violin for another whole year.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Or the cats howling in ecstasy along with the music it creates,&#x201d; Vincent Hunt, Viscount Darleigh, added. &#x201c;You might as well mention that too, Flave. There is no need to consider my sensibilities.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You play with a great deal more competence than you did last year, Vincent,&#x201d; Imogen Hayes, Lady Barclay, assured him. &#x201c;By next year I do not doubt you will have improved even further. You are a marvel and an inspiration to us all.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I may even dance to one of your tunes one of these days, provided it is not too sprightly, Vince.&#x201d; Sir Benedict Harper looked ruefully at the two canes propped against the arm of his chair.<br><br>&#x201c;You are not by any chance harboring a hope that we will all decide to stay a year or two longer in- stead of leaving tomorrow, George?&#x201d; Hugo Emes, Lord Trentham, asked, sounding almost wistful. &#x201c;I have never known three weeks to pass by so quickly. We arrived here, we blinked, and now it is time to go our separate ways again.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;George is far too p-polite to say a bald no, Hugo,&#x201d; Flavian told him. &#x201c;But life calls us hence, alas.&#x201d;<br><br>They were feeling somewhat maudlin, the seven of them, the members of the self-styled Survivors&#x2019; Club. Once, they had all spent several years here at Penderris, recuperating from wounds sustained during the Napoleonic Wars. Although each had had to fight a lone battle toward recovery, they had also aided and supported one another and grown as close as any brothers&#x2014;and sister. When the time had come for them to leave, to make new lives for themselves or to retrieve the old, they had gone with mingled eagerness and trepidation. Life was for living, they had all agreed, yet the cocoon in which they had been wrapped for so long had kept them safe and even happy. They had decided that they would return to Cornwall for a few weeks each year to keep alive their friendship, to share their experiences of life beyond the familiar confines of Penderris, and to help with any difficulty that may have arisen for one or more of them.<br><br>This had been the third such gathering. But now it was over for another year, or would be on the morrow.<br><br>Hugo got to his feet and stretched, expanding his already impressive girth, none of which owed anything to fat. He was the tallest and broadest of them, and the most fierce-looking, with his close-cropped hair and frequent frown.<br><br>&#x201c;The devil of it is that I do not want to put an end to any of this,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But if I am to make an early start in the morning, then I had better get to bed.&#x201d;<br><br>It was the signal for them all to rise. Most had lengthy journeys to make and hoped for an early departure.<br><br>Sir Benedict was the slowest to get to his feet. He had to gather his canes to his sides, slip his arms through the straps he had contrived, and haul himself painstakingly upward. Any of the others would have been glad to offer a helping hand, of course, but they knew better than to do so. They were all fiercely independent despite their various disabilities. Vincent, for example, would leave the room and climb the stairs to his own chamber unassisted despite the fact that he was blind. On the other hand, they would all wait for their slower friend and match their steps to his as they climbed the stairs.<br><br>&#x201c;P-pretty soon, Ben,&#x201d; Flavian said, &#x201c;you are going to be able to do that in under a minute.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Better than two, as it was last year,&#x201d; Ralph said. &#x201c;That really was a bit of a yawn, Ben.&#x201d;<br><br>They would not resist the urge to jab at him and tease him&#x2014;except, perhaps, Imogen.<br><br>&#x201c;Even two is remarkable for someone who was once told he must have both legs amputated if his life was to be saved,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;You are depressed, Ben.&#x201d; Hugo paused midstretch to make the observation.<br><br>Benedict shot him a glance. &#x201c;Just tired. It is late, and we are at the wrong end of our three-week stay. I always hate goodbyes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Imogen said, &#x201c;it is more than that, Ben. Hugo is not the only one to have noticed. We all have, but it has never come up during our nightly sessions.&#x201d;<br><br>They had sat up late most nights during the past three weeks, as they did each year, sharing some of their deeper concerns and insecurities&#x2014;and triumphs. They kept few secrets from one another. There were always some, of course. One&#x2019;s soul could never be laid quite bare to another person, no matter how close a friend. Ben had held his own soul close this year. He had been depressed. He still was. He felt chagrined, though, that he had not hidden his mood better.<br><br>&#x201c;Perhaps we are intruding where no help or sympathy is wanted,&#x201d; the duke said. &#x201c;Are we, Benedict? Or shall we sit back down and discuss it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;After I have just made the herculean effort to get up? And when everyone is about to totter off to bed in order to look fresh and beautiful in the morning?&#x201d; Ben laughed, but no one else shared his amusement.<br><br>&#x201c;You are depressed, Ben,&#x201d; Vincent said. &#x201c;Even I have noticed.&#x201d;<br><br>The others all sat again, and Ben, with a sigh, resumed his own seat. He had so nearly got away with it.<br><br>&#x201c;No one likes to be a whiner,&#x201d; he told them. &#x201c;Whiners are dead bores.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Agreed.&#x201d; George smiled. &#x201c;But you have never been a whiner, Benedict. None of us has. The rest of us would not have put up with it. Admitting problems, asking for help or even just for a friendly ear, is not whining. It is merely drawing upon the collective sympathies of people who know almost exactly what you are going through. Your legs are paining you, are they?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I never resent a bit of pain,&#x201d; Ben said without denying it. &#x201c;At least it reminds me that I still have my legs.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But&#x2014;?&#x201d;<br><br>George had not himself fought in the wars, though he had once been a military officer. His only son had fought, though, and had died in Portugal. His wife, the boy&#x2019;s mother, perhaps overcome with grief, flung herself to her death from the cliffs at the edge of the estate not long after. When he had opened his home to the six of them, as well as to others, George had been as wounded as any of them. He probably still was.<br><br>&#x201c;I will walk. I do walk after a fashion. And I will dance one day.&#x201d; Ben smiled ruefully. That had always been his boast, and the others often teased him about it.<br><br>No one teased now.<br><br>&#x201c;But&#x2014;?&#x201d; It was Hugo this time.<br><br>&#x201c;But I will never do either as I once did,&#x201d; Ben said. &#x201c;I suppose I have known it for a long time. I would be a fool not to have done so. But it has taken me six years to face up to the fact that I will never walk more than a few steps without my canes&#x2014;plural&#x2014;and that I will never move more than haltingly with them. I will never get my life back as it was. I will always be a cripple.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A harsh word, that,&#x201d; Ralph said with a frown. &#x201c;And a bit defeatist?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It is the simple truth,&#x201d; Ben said firmly. &#x201c;It is time to accept reality.&#x201d;<br><br>The duke rested his elbows on the arms of his chair and steepled his fingers. &#x201c;And accepting reality involves giving up and calling yourself a cripple?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You would never have got up off your bed, Benedict, if you had done that from the start. Indeed, you would have agreed to allow the army sawbones to relieve you of your legs altogether.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Admitting the truth does not mean giving up,&#x201d; Ben told him. &#x201c;But it does mean assessing reality and adjusting my life accordingly. I was a career military officer and never envisaged any other life for myself. I did not want any other life. I was going to end up a general. I have lived and toiled for the day when I could have that old life back. It is not going to happen, though. It never was. It is time I admitted it openly and dealt with it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You cannot be happy with a life outside the army?&#x201d; Imogen asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, I can be,&#x201d; Ben assured her. &#x201c;Of course I can. And will. It is just that I have spent six years denying real- ity, with the result that at this late date I still have no idea what the future does hold for me. Or what I want of the future. I have wasted those years yearning for a past that is long gone and will never return. You see? I am whining, and you could all be sleeping peacefully in your beds by now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I would r-rather be here,&#x201d; Flavian said. &#x201c;If one of us ever goes away from here unhappy because he c-couldn&#x2019;t bring himself to confide in the rest of us, then we m-might as well stop coming. George lives at the back of beyond here in Cornwall, after all. Who would want to c-come just for the scenery?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He is right, Ben.&#x201d; Vincent grinned. &#x201c;I would not come for the scenery.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You are not going home when you leave here, Ben,&#x201d; George said. It was a statement, not a question.<br><br>&#x201c;Beatrice&#x2014;my sister&#x2014;needs company,&#x201d; Ben explained with a shrug. &#x201c;She had a lingering chill through the winter and is only now getting her strength back with the spring. She does not feel up to moving to London when Gramley goes up after Easter for the opening of the parliamentary session. And her boys will be away at school.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The Countess of Gramley is fortunate to have such an agreeable brother,&#x201d; the duke said.<br><br>&#x201c;We were always particularly fond of each other,&#x201d; Ben told him.<br><br>But he had not answered George&#x2019;s implied question. And since the answer was a large part of the depression his friends had noticed, he felt obliged to give it. Flavian was right. If they could not share themselves with one another here, their friendship and these gatherings would lose meaning.<br><br>&#x201c;Whenever I go home to Kenelston,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;Calvin is unwilling to let me to do anything. He does not want me to set foot in the study or talk to my estate agent or visit any of my farms. He insists upon doing everything that needs to be done himself. His manner is always cheerful and hearty. It is as if he believes my brain has been rendered as crooked as my legs. And Julia, my sister-in-law, fusses over me, even to the point of clearing a path before me whenever I emerge from my own apartments. The children are allowed the run of the house, you see, and run they do, strewing objects as they go. She has my meals served in my private apartments so that I will not have to exert myself to go down to the dining room. She&#x2014;they both go a fair way, in fact, toward smothering me with kindness until I leave again.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; George said. &#x201c;Now we get to the heart of the matter.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They really do fear me,&#x201d; Ben said. &#x201c;They fairly pulsate with anxiety every moment I am there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I daresay your younger brother and his wife grew accustomed to thinking of your home as their own during the years you were here as a patient and then as a convalescent,&#x201d; George said. &#x201c;But you left here three years ago, Benedict.&#x201d;<br><br>Why had he not at that time taken possession of his own home and somehow forced his brother to make other provisions for his own family? That was the implied question. The trouble was, Ben did not have an answer, other than procrastination. Or out-and-out cowardice. Or&#x2014;something else.<br><br>He sighed. &#x201c;Families are complex.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They are,&#x201d; Vincent agreed with fervor. &#x201c;I feel for you, Ben.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My elder brother and Calvin were always very close,&#x201d; Ben explained. &#x201c;It was almost as if I, tucked in the middle, did not exist. Not that there was any hostility, just . . . indifference. I was their brother and they were mine, and that was that. Wallace was only ever interested in a future in politics and government. He lived in London, both before and after our father&#x2019;s death. When he succeeded to the baronetcy, he made it very clear that he was not in any way interested in either living at Kenelston or running the estate. Since Calvin was interested in both, and since he also married early and started a family, the two of them came to an arrangement that brought them mutual satisfaction. Calvin would live in the house and administer the estate for a consideration, and Wallace would pay the bills and draw on the proceeds but not have to bother his head about running any of it. Calvin did not expect&#x2014;none of us did&#x2014;that a loaded cart would topple onto Wallace near Covent Garden and kill him outright. It was too bizarre. That happened just a short while before I was wounded. I was not expected to survive either. Even after I was brought back to England and then here, I was not expected to live. You did not expect it, George, did you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;On the contrary,&#x201d; the duke said. &#x201c;I looked into your eyes the day you were brought here, Benedict, and knew you were too stubborn to die. I almost regretted it. I have never seen anyone suffer more pain than you. Your younger brother assumed, then, that the title and fortune and Kenelston itself would soon be entirely his?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It must have been a severe blow to him,&#x201d; Ben said with a rueful smile, &#x201c;when I lived. I am sure he has never forgiven me, though that makes him sound malicious, and really he is not. When I am away from home, he can carry on as he has since our father died. When I am there, he no doubt feels threatened&#x2014;and with good reason. Everything is mine by law, after all. And if Kenelston is not to be my home, where will be?&#x201d;<br><br>That was the question that had been plaguing him for three years.<br><br>&#x201c;My home is full of female relatives who love me to distraction,&#x201d; Vincent said. &#x201c;They would breathe for me if they could. They do everything else&#x2014;or so it seems. And soon&#x2014;I have already heard the rumblings of it&#x2014;they are going to be forcing potential brides on me because a blind man must need a wife to hold his hand through all the dark years that remain to him. My situ- ation is a little different from yours, Ben, but there are similarities. One of these days I am going to have to put my foot down and become master of my own house. But how to do it is the problem. How do you talk firmly to people you love?&#x201d;<br><br>Ben sighed and then chuckled. &#x201c;You are exactly right, Vince,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Perhaps you and I are just a couple of dithering weaklings. But Calvin has a wife and four children to provide for, while I have no one besides myself. And he is my brother. I do care for him, even if we were never close. It was a sheer accident of birth that made him the third-born son and me the second.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You feel g-guilty for having inherited the baronetcy, Ben?&#x201d; Flavian asked.<br><br>&#x201c;I never expected it, you see,&#x201d; Ben explained. &#x201c;There was no one more robust or full of life than Wallace. Besides, I never wanted to be anything but a military officer. I certainly never expected Kenelston to be mine. But it is, and I sometimes think that if I could simply go there and immerse myself in running the estate, perhaps I would finally feel settled and would proceed to live happily ever after.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But your home is occupied by other people,&#x201d; Hugo said. &#x201c;I would go in there for you if you wanted, Ben, and clear them all out. I would scowl and look tough, and they would toddle off without so much as a squeal of protest. But that is not the point, is it?&#x201d;<br><br>Ben joined in the general laughter.<br><br>&#x201c;Life was simple in the army,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Brute force solved all problems.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Until...</p><h2>Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases</h2><p>The thirty five chapters in this book describe various judgmental heuristics and the biases they produce, not only in laboratory experiments but in important social, medical, and political situations as well. Individual chapters discuss the representativeness and availability heuristics, problems in judging covariation and control, overconfidence, multistage inference, social perception, medical diagnosis, risk perception, and methods for correcting and improving judgments under uncertainty. About half of the chapters are edited versions of classic articles; the remaining chapters are newly written for this book. Most review multiple studies or entire subareas of research and application rather than describing single experimental studies. This book will be useful to a wide range of students and researchers, as well as to decision makers seeking to gain insight into their judgments and to improve them.</p><p>Thirty-five chapters describe various judgmental heuristics and the biases they produce, not only in laboratory experiments, but in important social, medical, and political situations as well.

Staretz Silouan was a Russian peasant whose only formal education consisted of two winters at the village school. But on Mt Athos, rooted in a tradition reaching back to the very beginnings of Christian monasticism, he was taught of God and attained wisdom akin to that of the Desert Fathers. </p><p><i>Wisdom from Mount Athos</i> is a collection of the notes which Staretz Silouan penciled on odd scraps of paper.

Often shame comes from being raised in a family that has an impaired ability to provide its members with healthy nurturing. As a result, you carry emotional scars into adult life, longing for happiness but feeling unworthy of it. Sandra Wilson knows much about "shame-based" families--both from personal experience and from her years as a family therapist. Drawing from this background, she teaches you biblical principles that have helped her and many others work through painful issues and learn new, healthier ways to live. In this revised edition, Wilson also includes help for parents who want to break the intergenerational cycle of shame and give their children a "grace-based" foundation for life.</p><p>Sandra D. Wilson is a seminary professor, certified spiritual director and retired family therapist. She is an international speaker and the author of six books: <em>Released from Shame, Into Abba's Arms, Hurt People Hurt People, The World According to Me, Shame-Free Parenting</em> and <em>Counseling Adult Children of Alcoholics.</em>"God's perfect love certainly can cast out fear, but I never truly understood how God does that until learning more about being a shame-based person. Sandra Wilson has written an incredibly needed resource--especially for those of us from shame-based cultures--on how finally to experience exquisite freedom in Christ." (Rev. Ken Fong, senior pastor, Evergreen Baptist Church, Los Angeles)<br><br>"In the midst of a veritable flood of books on the subject, this one stands out.

When he died in 1989 at the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota, he was widely loved and respected. <p><i>Fools Crow</i> is based on interviews conducted in the 1970s. The holy man tells Thomas E.

Immigrant criolla here reporting desde Los Mayamis from our ant-infested townhouse. The air conditioner broke, too. Below it was the TV, the flowery couch, La Tata half-drunk directing me in this holy radionovela brought to you by Female Sadness Incorporated. That morning as we unpacked the last of our bags, we&#x2019;d found Tata&#x2019;s old radio. So the two of us practiced our latest melodrama in the living room while on the TV Don Francisco saluted el pueblo de Miami <em>damas y caballeros!</em> And Tata, (at this age!) to Mami&#x2019;s exasperation and my delight, went girl crazy over his manly voice.</p> <p>Y como quien no quiere la cosa, Mami angrily turned off the stove where La Tata left the bacalao frying unattended, then Lysol-sprayed the countertops, smashing the dark trail of ants hustling some pancito for their colony in the back of the fridge. Girlfriend was pissed. She didn&#x2019;t come to the U S of A to kill ants and smell like puto pescado, and how lovely would it have been if Consuelo could have joined us on the plane? Then Mami could have left Consuelo to the house-chore duties and concentrated on the execution of this Migration Project. Pero, al�? Is she the only person awake en esta berraca casa?</p> <p>On the TV, another commercial for <em>Ingl�s Sin Barreras</em> and Luc�a, La Tata and I chuckled at the white people teaching brown people how to say, Hello My Name Is. Hello, I am going to the store. Hello, what is this swamp please come rescue us. It was June and hot. Not that the heat dissipated in July or August or September or even November, for that matter. The heat, I would come to learn the hard way, is a constant in Miami. El calorcito didn&#x2019;t get the impermanence memo, didn&#x2019;t understand how change works. Na-ha. The heat is a stubborn bitch breathing its humid mouth on your every pore, reminding you this hell is inescapable and in another language.</p> <p>We&#x2019;d been there for a month, newly arrived, still saladitas, and I already wanted to go back home to Colombia, return to my panela land, its mountains and that constant anxiety that comes just by living in Bogot�. That anxiety that I nonetheless understood better than this new, terrifying one. But Mami explained to me over and over again with a smirk that look around you, Francisca, <em>this</em> is your home now.</p> <p>Our To-Do List that doomed Saturday of the ants and the bacalao included helping Mami with the preparations for the celebration of the death or the baptism or the rebirth or the something of her miscarried dead baby, Sebasti�n. It has been argued&#x2014;by the only people who care to argue, La Tata and her hermanas&#x2014; that my dead brother&#x2019;s baptism was the most exciting event in the Mart�nez Juan family that summer. This mainly because La Tata drank half a bottle of rum a day, couldn&#x2019;t keep Monday from Friday, so obviously a fake baby&#x2019;s baptism at a pastor&#x2019;s pool was more important to her than, say, the fact that by the end of the summer my sister Luc�a regularly woke in the middle of the night to pray over me. Or the fact that I will eventually remember this time, the first months of our arrival, as Mami&#x2019;s most sane, grounded moment.</p> <p>Pero we&#x2019;re getting ahead of ourselves, cachaco. Primero la primaria.</p> <p>We&#x2019;d been prepping for the baptism celebration even before departing from our apartment on the third floor down in Bogot�. Inside the six Samsonite bags that Mami, Luc�a, and yours truly were allowed to bring into this new! exciting! think-of-it-as-moving-up-the-social-ladder! life were black-and-gold tablecloths, hand-crafted invitations, and other various baptism paraphernalia. There wasn&#x2019;t enough space for the box of letters from my friends or our photo albums, but we nonetheless packed two jars of holy water (instead of my collection of CDs&#x2014;The Cure, The Velvet Underground, The Ramones, Salser�n) blessed three days before by our neighborhood priest, water that was confiscated for hours by customs (<em>You don&#x2019;t think we got water in the States?</em>) then quickly flushed down the toilet by T�a Milagros, who now soaking in Jes�s&#x2019;s Evangelical Christian blessing believed, like the rest of the Miami matriarchy, that Catholic priests were a bunch of degenerados, buenos para nada. Catholicism is a fake <em>and</em> boring religion. Christianity is the true exciting path to a blessed life in the name of Jesucristo nuestro se�or, okey?</p> <p>Now Mami hustled her bare butt around the dining room, head tilted hugging the telephone, wearing only shorts and a push-up bra, fanning herself with a thick envelope from the stack of unopened bills. Anxiously phoning the pastores, the incompetent flower people (Colombianos ten�an que ser), the two lloronas in black&#x2014;Milagros&#x2019;s idea&#x2014;would professionally mourn Sebasti�n while charging Mami fifteen dollars an hour.</p> <p>MAMI WANTED A DEAD BABY&#x2019;S BAPTISM, MOTHERFUCKER, AND SHE WAS GONNA <em>GIVE IT</em>.</p> <p>&nbsp;Homegirl didn&#x2019;t see anything wrong with chipping away&#x2014;I would found out later&#x2014;at our life savings by buying tears and feeding the congregation.</p> <p>&nbsp;Pero&#x2014;�yeme&#x2014;you couldn&#x2019;t fight her.</p> <p>Esa platica ya se hab�a perdido. Esta coste�a estaba montada en el bus already. Mami never got a break. Never stopped to smell the flowers. C�mo se te ocurre. From the moment we arrived, Myriam del Socorro Juan was on her crazed trip to get-shit-done. We were handed to-do lists; we were yelled at, directed; we were being told what to do every single step of the way.</p> <p>We were obedient. What else could we do? Where else could we go?</p> <p>The outskirts of Miami is dead land. It is lago sucio after dirty lake with billboards and highways advertising diet pills and breast implants. With almost inexistent public transportation, no sidewalks, but a glorious Walmart and a Publix Sabor where a herd of Colombianos who came all the way from their land buy frozen arepas and microwavable Goya plantains. Luc�a wasn&#x2019;t complaining. La Tata barely had strength to fight Mami.

The recipes in &#x201c;Vegetables to Envy&#x201d; range from a South Indian dish of cabbage with black mustard seeds to French grandmother&#x2013;style vegetables. &#x201c;Strike While the Iron Is Hot&#x201d; is all about searing and quick cooking in a cast-iron skillet. Another chapter highlights dishes you can eat from a bowl with a spoon.

It's one of London's upmarket areas-not on the level of Westminster or Chelsea, but a long way from cheap. London has a lot of places like Canonbury, old expensive terraced houses crammed into winding tree-lined streets, with small parks in between where people walk their dogs. For the most part, mages don't visit them. It's true that mages are more common in cities, but there are close to ten million people in London, and that's enough to dilute the mage population pretty heavily, even if they wanted to spread out, which they don't. So they cluster, and the areas in between fall off their radar, to the point where the average mage knows about as much about the residents of Canonbury as the average resident of Canonbury knows about mages. It's symmetrical, I suppose.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Right now we were standing under a sycamore tree, looking across the street towards a house on the other side. It was a July evening, with the sun setting behind the rooftops, and the air was still and warm. From around us, voices and chatter drifted up, the sounds of traffic coming from the main roads nearby. Anne had led me here by a roundabout route, taking a path down an old canal lined with benches and willow trees. It had been a pretty walk and I'd enjoyed it, but I had the feeling it had been a delaying tactic.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Neither do you," I told her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Yes I do," Anne said. "You don't have to."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Would you really prefer to go in on your own?" I asked. "Anyway, look on the bright side. You're not going on trial this time."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"That's what you think." Anne thought for a minute. "How long will we have?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Until we get the go signal?" I asked. "Call it about a twenty percent chance for the next hour, forty percent for one to two hours, twenty percent for later, and twenty for never."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"So that's a forty percent chance of being stuck here all night."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I leant in and kissed the side of Anne's head. "Come on. Are we really going to come this far, then turn around and leave?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anne sighed. "I suppose not."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We crossed the street and walked up the steps to the house. It was on the large side for a terrace, with bay windows. Anne rang the bell and as we stood waiting, we heard footsteps approaching from the other side.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The door swung open, light and noise spilling out into the summer evening. From down the hallway I could hear the sound of chatter and raised voices. The woman who'd opened the door was in her fifties with greying hair, and wore an evening dress and a pearl necklace. "Oh good, you're here. We were starting to think you wouldn't make it. Alex, wasn't it? Do come in. Anne, the coats are going in the hall."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I sat at the dinner table and felt out of place.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There were seven others in the dining room. The woman who'd greeted us was sitting at the head of the table, presiding over the meal. At her right side was her husband, a thin, melancholy-looking man currently focused on drinking his soup. Occupants three through six were the two daughters and their partners. Number seven was Anne.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>". . . just can't understand how anyone like that can get elected," the younger daughter was saying. "I mean . . . no? Just no?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Well, it's lack of education, isn't it?" the boy who'd come with her said. "The funny thing is that they're voting against their own interests. You'd think they'd be able to see . . ."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was odd to think that this was the house that Anne had grown up in. Well, one of them. According to Anne, when she'd first been placed with the family, it had been in Finchley-they'd moved to Canonbury when she was twelve so that the elder daughter, Elizabeth, could go to a better school. That had been fourteen years ago, and apparently they'd been living here ever since.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I looked around at the dining room. Most of the walls were taken up with shelves, with plates and bowls mounted upon them, well spaced. There were several chests of drawers, all covered with white lace tablecloths. Despite its size, the room felt cramped. It didn't really feel like a room for living in, one where you could stretch out and put your feet up: it was a display room, every piece of glass and china arranged for effect. A partition led into the living room, and a door at the side opened into a hallway containing the stairs and the entrance to the kitchen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The older boyfriend was talking now. He was English, with short brown hair and narrow glasses, and looked to be a good five to ten years older than his fianc&#x17d;e. ". . . real problem is that people aren't listening enough to experts," he was saying. "Instead they're being influenced by private elements in the media. All these billionaires who can just manufacture fake stories. I mean, we try to do the best we can to provide a more balanced view, but . . ."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"It must be very difficult," the mother said sympathetically. Her husband sipped his soup.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anne and I had been a couple for a year now. I'd suggested meeting her family more than once, but Anne had put it off, and now that I was here it wasn't hard to see why. My time on the Council had gotten me into the habit of paying attention to social hierarchies, and on reflex I'd found myself analysing the other people around the table. The mother was the head of the household, and both the elder daughter, Elizabeth, and her fianc&#x17d;, Johnathan, apparently had her approval. Elizabeth wore an engagement ring with a large diamond, positioned prominently. Neither the mother nor Johnathan wanted me here. In the case of Johnathan, the reason wasn't hard to guess: he considered himself the alpha male of the group and I was an intruder. The mother's issues were less obvious, and I suspected they were something deeper, something involving Anne.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The younger sister apparently held less favour in her mother's eyes, judging by the choice of seating. Neither she nor her boyfriend had been paying attention to me so far, but I knew that when trouble started, it would come from her. As I formed the thought, I couldn't help but smile. Trouble. What a dramatic way to put it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Why don't you ask Alex?" the younger daughter said brightly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Johnathan had been in mid-flow; the question caught him off guard. "What?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Well, you were just saying that the government ought to do more, weren't you?" the younger daughter said. According to Anne, her name was Grace. "Didn't she say you work for the government?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"More or less," I agreed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"So what do you think the government should be doing to cut down on populism?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Come now, Grace," the mother cut in smoothly. "We shouldn't ask him to talk business at the dinner table."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"No, that's fine," I said. "The first answer would be that it's a loaded question."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"What?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You're assuming that populism's a bad thing that needs to be stopped."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Isn't it?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I shrugged. "Most of the time, when someone says 'populism' in that context, they mean 'something that's popular that I don't like.' If they like it, they call it 'democracy' or 'representation.' It isn't the government's job to promote your opinion at the expense of everyone else."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"But come on, now," Johnathan broke in. "You have to admit that so many of our recent problems have been because the government hasn't been stepping in."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"That's one way to look at it."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Don't you agree?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Actually, the majority of my work these days revolves around solving problems originally caused by the people I work for."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Johnathan paused; obviously the conversation wasn't going the way he'd been expecting. The other people at the table had fallen silent, watching our back-and-forth. The only one who wasn't looking at us was Anne.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Johnathan tried to rally. "I suppose the core of the problem is the recent trend of anti-intellectualism."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Is that what you'd call it?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Of course."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"So you think the issue is . . . what? That people don't respect cleverness enough?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Not just cleverness," Johnathan said. "Expertise, depth of knowledge. Wisdom, even. Instead they end up following people who promise them easy solutions."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Well, there's definitely some truth to that," I said. "I have to spend a lot of time trying to explain to people that the situation's more complicated than establishment bad, rebels good. And there's a real danger of getting demagogues in a situation like that. People are so focused on the establishment that they don't notice that they're being duped by the ones who are claiming to be on their side."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There were several nods. Johnathan was about to speak, but I kept going. "But none of that really explains where the animosity towards the establishment came from. And it's a mistake to chalk that up to anti-intellectualism. They don't think that the people in charge are stupid or uninformed. They just don't trust them. Big difference."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"So you'd say that the problem's a lack of communication?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You mean that the problem is that the government hasn't done enough to get its message out?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Yes, exactly."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I nodded. "Then no."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"What?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"The people I'm dealing with think the establishment doesn't care about them because, for the most part, the establishment doesn't care about them. Stepping up the propaganda isn't going to make much difference."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"It's not propaganda."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Whatever you call it, if you keep saying one thing and doing another, people eventually notice."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Johnathan tried to think of something else to say. The mother cut in. "Which department did you say you worked for again?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"It's usually security work."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You mean you're part of the police?" Elizabeth said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Not exactly," I said. "I can't really go into details."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Because if you told us, you'd have to kill us?" the younger boyfriend said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I smiled politely at the stale joke. There were several laughs. "Guess we'd better be careful what we say around you," the boy said. "Might be being recorded."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You don't need to be so melodramatic," Johnathan said. He was trying to keep his tone light but there was an edge to his voice. "He probably spends all his time sitting in meetings."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"A lot of my days are like that."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Well, has everyone finished?" the mother said. There was a murmur of agreement and she looked over. "Anne, I think it's time to bring the dessert in."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anne nodded and rose to her feet. I didn't look after her as she left; Johnathan's last words had stirred up memories. Meetings . . .</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Keeper briefing room was ugly, peeling paint and cheap tables. The chairs were uncomfortable enough that most of the people in the room had chosen to stand, forming a loose circle. Blinds had been pulled down over the windows, and the only light was coming from the illuminated map at the centre of the room.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The map was a projection, three-dimensional and sculpted out of light, and it showed a section of landscape a little over a square mile in size, the hills rising almost to waist height and the valleys falling to the level of my knees. The bulk of the terrain was covered in trees: most of the rest was undergrowth or open field. There was only one building, low-slung with two long wings. From above, and at this scale, it looked quite small.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"The Order of the Star's current plan is to attack in a pincer," I said. As I spoke, I channelled through the focus: translucent blue arrows appeared on the map, sweeping down from east and west towards the mansion's two wings. "They'll gate as close as possible to the edge of the ward radius, then move in. Constructs will be on point, with security forces in the second wave and guarding the flanks. Primary objectives are here and here"-green dots appeared in the wings-"with secondary objectives spread through the ground and first floors." Lighter green dots appeared as I spoke, covering the building. "The goal is to take the above-ground sections of the building in the initial surprise attack."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Excellent!" Landis said. Tall and lanky, he was half leaning on one of the tables. "Wonderful thing, optimism. Might I enquire what the plan is should they fail to do so?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I smiled slightly. "Director Nimbus didn't feel it necessary to go into the details."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There were various noises of displeasure from around the room. "Correct me if I'm wrong," one of the other Keepers said, "but I thought you were on the Junior Council."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Correct."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Doesn't that mean you outrank Nimbus?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Also correct," I said. "However, he demanded field command for this operation, which the Council granted. Director Nimbus also made the decision for the primary attack force to be drawn from the Order of the Star, holding Shield Keepers in reserve. Which is the reason we're here."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Director Nimbus can't find his own arse with both hands and a map," a third Keeper suggested.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Didn't quite hear that," I said, and looked around the circle. "Opinions?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Keeper who'd pointed out my rank crouched down, studying the landscape thoughtfully. The light projection fuzzed around his legs. His name was Tobias, and he was a dark-haired man in his forties who, for reasons best known to himself, wore a large Stetson hat. "Don't like it," he said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Reasons?" I asked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tobias pointed down at the landscape. "Too far from the entry point to the target, not enough cover. Easy cross fire."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"With surprise-" another Keeper said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"One never wants to depend entirely on surprise," Landis said. "Drakh has unfortunately proven quite skilled at anticipating attacks in the past. Which regretfully leads me back to my earlier question as to the presence or otherwise of our backup plan. I do hope that we're not it?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Unfortunately, I rather suspect we are."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tobias nodded as if he'd been expecting it. "Of course," another Keeper said. "Wouldn't be a job for the Order of the Shield otherwise, would it?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Why don't we just blow the place up?" someone asked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Because the objective isn't to destroy the mansion," I said. "The Council want Richard Drakh, alive if possible. Secondary objective is to recover any strategic intelligence an...</p></p><h2>School Counseling to Close the Achievement Gap: A Social Justice Framework for Success</h2><p><i>"The author is way ahead of the game on this one.

But one day, he noticed a troubling weakness in his hand. At first, he brushed it off as carpal tunnel syndrome, but after a week of neurological exams and two MRIs, he learned the cause of the problem: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, better known as ALS or Lou Gehrig&#x2019;s disease. At age 32, Ady was given just three to four years to live. Yet despite the devastating diagnosis, he refused to let his remaining days go to waste.<br> <br><i>Eyes to the Wind </i>is a rousing memoir featuring intertwining storylines about determination, perseverance, and how to live a life filled with purpose and intention. The first traces Ady&#x2019;s battle with ALS: how he turned the initial shock and panic from his diagnosis into a renewed commitment to social justice&#x2014;not despite his disability but because of it. The second, told in flashbacks, illustrates Ady&#x2019;s journey from a goofy political nerd to a prominent figure in the enduring fight for equity and justice who is &#x201c;willing to give [his] last breath to save our democracy&#x201d; (CNN).<br> <br>From one of today&#x2019;s most vocal advocates for social justice, <i>Eyes to the Wind</i> is an evocative and unforgettable memoir about activism, dedication, love, and hope.</p><p>Ady Barkan is a social justice activist who has built three programs at The Center for Popular Democracy: the Be A Hero and Fed Up campaigns and the Local Progress network. He was a law clerk to the Hon. Shira A. Scheindlin in the Southern District of New York and prior to that he was a Liman Fellow with Make the Road New York, where he represented low-wage workers seeking to recover unpaid wages and obtain safe and dignified working conditions. He graduated from Yale Law School and Columbia College. He lives with his wife Rachael and their young son Carl in Santa Barbara, California. <i>Eyes to the Wind</i> is his first book.&#x201c;In the fight for social justice, giving up is not an option. From the halls of Congress to street corners across the country, Ady Barkan has become an American hero &#x2013; placing his ailing body on the line for basic human rights. <i>Eyes to the Wind</i> is the gripping story of resistance and the triumph of human will. Barkan retells the timeless story of a parent&#x2019;s love as he vividly details a very personal narrative of how far a father will go so that he can leave the world a little better than he found it.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Senator Elizabeth Warren</b><br><br>&#x201c;Ady Barkan is an American hero.

Whether by fighting for a fairer tax code, universal health care, or a better judiciary, he has done more for this country while suffering from ALS than most do in their lifetime. <i>Eyes to the Wind</i>&nbsp;is more than just a memoir; it&#x2019;s a meditation on illness, an expos� of our broken health care system, and a 21st-century guide to organizing. It&#x2019;s also a powerful reminder that losing everything you take for granted can end up inspiring great change. Just as in his organizing, Ady&#x2019;s writing is driven by a deep humanity and sense of empathy.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Representative Ilhan Omar</b><br><br>&#x201c;In the face of death, Ady Barkan has written a beautiful, poignant story about what it means to live. His commitment to our collective struggle for democracy amid his own grueling battle with ALS is the most inspiring example of activism I&#x2019;ve ever known, and a reminder that even in trying times and unimaginable circumstances, it&#x2019;s possible to lead a life filled with joy, purpose, love, and peace. This memoir is a gift to anyone who dreams of a better world.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Jon Favreau,</b><b> cohost of <i>Pod Save America</i> and former communications director and speechwriter for President Barack Obama</b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Eyes to the Wind</i> will move you through every emotion and leave you transformed.

When finally she turned to her consort, her voice dripped ice. "Summon the council."<br><br><i>Second Prologue<br></i><b><br><br></b>Thousands of years before the birth of Christ, there settled in Ireland a race called the Tuatha D� Danaan who, over time, became known as the True Race or the Fairy.<br><br>An advanced civilization from a faraway world, the Tuatha D� Danaan educated some of the more promising humans they encountered in Druid ways. For a time, man and fairy shared the earth in peace, but sadly, bitter dissension arose between them, and the Tuatha D� Danaan decided to move on. Legend claims they were driven "under the hills" into "fairy mounds." The truth is they never left our world, but hold their fantastic court in places difficult for humans to find.<br><br>After the Tuatha D� Danaan left, the human Druids warred among themselves for power. Thirteen of their once faithful Druids turned to dark ways and-thanks to what the Tuatha D� Danaan had taught them-nearly destroyed the earth.<br><br>The Tuatha D� Danaan emerged from their hidden places and stopped the battle moments before the Druids succeeded in damaging the earth beyond repair. They stripped the Druids of their power, scattering them to the far corners of the earth. They punished the thirteen who'd turned dark by casting them into a place between dimensions, locking their immortal souls in an eternal prison.<br><br>The Tuatha D� Danaan then selected a noble bloodline, the Keltar, to use the sacred knowledge to rebuild and nurture the land. Together they negotiated The Compact: the treaty governing cohabitation of their races. The Keltar swore many oaths to the Tuatha D� Danaan, first and foremost that they would never use the power of the standing stones-which give the man who knows the sacred formulas the ability to move through space and time-for personal gain or political ends. The Tuatha D� Danaan pledged many things in return, first and foremost that they would never spill the lifeblood of a mortal. Both races have long abided by the pledges made that day.<br><br>Over the ensuing millennia, the MacKeltar journeyed to Scotland and settled in the Highlands above what is now called Inverness. Although most of their ancient history from the time of their involvement with the Tuatha D� Danaan has melted into the mists of their distant past and been forgotten, and although there is no record of a Keltar encountering a Tuatha D� Danaan since then (giving rise to speculation that the ancient race no longer exists), they have never strayed from their sworn purpose.<br><br>Pledged to serve the greater good of the world, no MacKeltar has ever broken his sacred oath. On the few occasions they have opened a gate to other times within the circle of stones, it has been for the noblest of reasons: to protect the earth from great peril. An ancient legend holds that if a MacKeltar breaks his oath and uses the stones to travel through time for personal purposes, the myriad souls of the darkest Druids trapped in the in-between will claim him and make him the most evil, terrifyingly powerful Druid humankind has ever known.<br><br>In the fifteenth century, twin brothers Drustan and Dageus MacKeltar are born. As their ancestors before them, they protect the ancient tore, nurture the land, and guard the coveted secret of the standing stones.<br><br>Honorable men, without corruption, Dageus and Drustan serve faithfully.<br><br>Until one fateful night, in a moment of blinding grief Dageus MacKeltar violates the sacred Compact.<br><br>When his brother Drustan is killed, Dageus enters the circle of stones and goes back in time to event Dnistan's death. He succeeds, but between dimensions is taken by the souls of the evil Druids who have not tasted or touched or smelled, not made love or danced or vied for powet for nearly four thousand years.<br><br>Now Dageus MacKeltar is a man with one good conscience-and thirteen bad ones. Although he can hold his own for a white, his time is growing short.<br><br>The darkest Druid currently resides in the East 70s in Manhattan, and that is where our story begins.<br><br><i>CHAPTER 1</i><b><br></b>Dageus MacKeltar walked like a man and talked like a man, but in bed he was pure animal.<br><br>Criminal attorney Katherine O'Malley called a spade a spade, and the man was raw Sex with a capital S. Now that she'd slept with him she was ruined for other men.<br><br>It wasn't just what he looked like, with his sculpted body,skin poured like gold velvet over steel, chiseled features, and silky black hair. Or that lazy, utterly arrogant smile that promised a woman paradise. And delivered. One hundred percent satisfaction guaranteed.<br><br>It wasn't even the exotic golden eyes fringed by thick black lashes beneath slanted brows.<br><br>It was what he did to her.<br><br>He was sex like she'd never had in her life, and Katherine had been having sex for seventeen years. She thought she'd seen it all. But when Dageus MacKeltar touched her, she came apart at the seams. Aloof, his every movement smoothly controlled, when he stripped off his clothing he stripped off every ounce of that rigid discipline and turned into an untamed barbarian. He fucked with the single-minded intensity of a man on death row, execution at dawn.<br><br>Just thinking about him made places low in her belly clench. Made her skin felt stretched too tight across her bones. Made her breath come short and sharp.<br><br>Now, standing in the anteroom outside the enameled French doors of his exquisite Manhattan penthouse overlooking Central Park that fit him like a second skin-starkly elegant, black, white, chrome, and hard-she felt intensely alive, every nerve wired. Drawing a deep breath, she turned the handle and pushed open the door.<br><br>It was never locked. As if he feared nothing, forty-three floors above the flash and razor edges of the city. As if he'd seen the worst the Big Apple had to offer and found it all mildly amusing. As if the city might be big and bad, but he was bigger and badder.<br><br>She stepped inside, inhaling the rich scent of sandalwood and roses. Classical music spilled through the luxurious rooms-Mozart's Requiem-but she knew that later he might play Nine Inch Nails, and stretch her naked body against the wall of windows that overlooked the conservatory water, driving into her until she screamed her release to the bright city lights below.<br><br>Sixty feet of coveted Fifth Avenue frontage in the East 70s-and she had no idea what he did for a living. Most of the time she wasn't certain she wanted to know.<br><br>She pushed the doors shut behind her and allowed the buttery-soft folds of her leather coat to spill to the floor, revealing black lace-topped thigh-highs, matching panties, and a sheer push-up bra that presented her full breasts to perfection. She caught a glimpse of her reflection in the darkened windows and smiled. At thirty-three, Katherine O'Malley looked good. She should look good, she thought, arching a brow, as much exercise as she'd been getting in his bed. Or on the floor. Sprawled across the leather sofa. In his black marble Jacuzzi...<br><br>A wave of lust made her dizzy, and she breathed deeply to slow her pounding heart. Around him, she felt insatiable. A time or two, she'd briefly entertained the outrageous thought that he might not be human. That maybe he was some mythical sex-god, perhaps Priapus beckoned by the needy inhabitants of the city that never slept. Or some creature of long-forgotten lore, a Sidhe that had the ability to heighten pleasure to extremes mortals weren't meant to taste.<br><br>"Katie-lass." His voice floated down from the top floor of, the fifteen-room duplex, dark and rich, his Scottish accent making her think of peat-smoke, ancient stones, and aged whisky.<br><br>Only Dageus MacKeltar could get away with calling Katherine O'Malley "Katie-lass."<br><br>As he descended the curving staircase and entered the thirty-foot living room with its vaulted ceilings, marble fireplace, and panoramic view of the park, she remained motionless, drinking him in. He wore black linen trousers, and she knew there would be nothing beneath them but the most perfect male body she'd ever seen. Her gaze drifted over his wide shoulders, down his hard chest and his rippling abs, lingering on the twin ropes of muscle that cut his lower stomach and disappeared into his pants, beckoning the eye to follow.<br><br>"Good enough to eat?" His golden eyes glittered as they raked her body. "Come." He extended his hand. "Lass, you take my breath away. Your wish is my command this eve. You have only to tell me."<br><br>His long midnight hair, so black it seemed as blue-black as his shadow beard in the amber glow of recessed lights, spilled over one muscled shoulder, falling to his waist, and she sucked in a quick breath. She knew the feel of it sweeping her bare breasts, abrading her nipples, falling lower, across her thighs as he brought her to peak after shuddering peak.<br><br>"As if I need to say anything. You know what I want before I know myself." She heard the edge in her voice, knew he heard it too. It unnerved her, how well he understood her. Before she knew what she wanted, he was giving it to her.<br><br>It made him dangerously addictive.<br><br>He smiled, but it didn't quite reach his eyes. She wasn't certain she'd ever seen it reach his eyes. They never changed, merely observed and waited. Like a tiger's golden eyes, his were watchful yet aloof, amused yet detached. Hungry eyes. Predator eyes. More than once she'd wanted to ask what those tiger-eyes saw. What judgment they passed, what the hell he seemed to be waiting for, but in the bliss of his hard body against hers she forgot time and again, until she was back at work and it was too late to ask.<br><br>She'd been sleeping with him for two months, and knew no more about him now than the day she'd met him in Starbucks, across the street from O'Leary Banks and O'Malley, where she was a partner, thanks partly to her father, the senior O'Malley, and partly to her own ruthlessness. One look at the six-foot-four, darkly seductive man over the rim of her caf� au lait, and she'd known she had to have him. It might have had something to do with the way he'd locked eyes with her as he'd lazily licked whipped cream off his mocha, making her imagine that sexy tongue doing far more intimate things. It might have had something to do with the pure sexual heat he gave off. She knew it had a great deal to do with the danger that rolled off him. Some days she wondered if she'd be defending him as one of her controversial high-profile clients in the months or years to come.<br><br>That same day they'd met, they'd rolled across his white Berber carpet, from fireplace to windows, wrestling silently for the supreme position, until she'd no longer cared how he'd taken her, so long as he had.<br><br>With a reputation for a razor-sharp tongue and the mind to back it up, she'd never once turned it on him. She had no idea how he maintained his lavish lifestyle, how he afforded his obscenely expensive collections of art and ancient weapons. She didn't know where he'd been born, or even when his birthday was.<br><br>At work, she'd mentally prepare her interrogatory but inevitably the probing questions stalled on her tongue the moment she saw him. She, the merciless interrogator in a courtroom, tongue-tied in his bedroom. On occasion, tied in infinitely more pleasurable ways. The man was a true master of the erotic.<br><br>"Woolgatherin', lass? Or merely deciding how you want me?" he purred.<br><br>Katherine wet her lips. How she wanted him?<br><br>She wanted him out of her system. Kept hoping the next time she slept with him, the sex might not be so mindblowing. The man was far too dangerous to get involved with emotionally. Just yesterday she'd lingered at Mass, praying that she would get over her addiction to him-please, God, soon. Yes, he heated her blood, but there was something about him that chilled her soul.<br><br>In the meantime-hopelessly fascinated as she was-she knew exactly how she would have him. A strong woman, she was aroused by the strength of a dominant man. She would end the night sprawled over his leather sofa. He would fist his hand in her long hair, drive into her from behind. He would bite the nape of her neck when she came.<br><br>She inhaled sharply, took one step forward, and he was on her, dragging her down to the thick carpet. Firm lips, sensual, with a hint of cruelty, dosed over hers as he kissed her, golden eyes narrowing.<br><br>There was something about him that bordered on terrifying, she thought as he pinned her hands to the floor and rose over her, too beautiful, rife with dark secrets she suspected no woman should ever know-and it made the sex so much more exquisite, that fine edge of danger.<br><br>It was her last coherent thought for a long, long time.<br><br>*******<br><br>Dageus MacKeltar braced his palms against the wall of windows and stared out into the night, his body separated from a plunge of forty-three stories by a pane of glass. The soft buzz of the television was nearly lost in the patter of rain against the windows. A few fret to his right, the sixtyinch screen was reflected in the glistening glass and David Boreanaz stalked broodingly, playing Angel, the tortured vampire with a soul. Dageus watched long enough to ascertain it was a repeat, then let his gaze drift back to the night.<br><br>The vampire always found at least partial resolution, and Dageus had begun to fear that for him, there would be none. Ever.<br><br>Besides, his problem was a little more complicated than Angel's. Angel's problem was a soul. Dageus's was a legion of them.<br><br>Raking a hand through his hair, he studied the city below. Manhattan: A mere twenty-two square miles. Inhabited by nearly two million people. Then there was the metropolis itself, with seven million people crammed into three hundred square miles.<br><br>It was a city of grotesque proportions to a sixteenth-century Highlander, the sheer immensity inconceivable. When he'd first arrived in New York City, he'd walked around the Empire State Building for hours. One hundred and two floors, ten million bricks, the interior thirty-seven million cubic feet, one thousand two hundred and fifty feet tall, it was struck by lightning an average of five hundred times per year.<br><br>What manner of man built such monstrosities? he'd wondered. Sheer insanity was what it was, the Highlander had marveled.<br><br>And a fine place to call home.<br><br>New York City had beckoned the darkness within him. He'd made his lair in the pulsing heart of it.<br><br>A man without clan, outcast, nomad, he'd doffed the sixteenth-century man like so much worn plaid.

In the context of a complete theology, which includes extended consideration of the major theological topics the Trinity, Christology, eschatology, ministry, and sacrament, but above all, the Eucharist the author propounds a fresh understanding, based on the early Fathers and the Orthodox tradition, of the concept of person, and so of the Church itself.

But if you don't mind a little ribbing, take a look at the following haiku, which gives only a mild taste of the yummy-as-lox treats gathered in this collection: "Jewish voodoo tip -- / mention an acting career, / then watch for chest pain."

Determined to better himself, the �ber-intelligent Hamilton attended King&#x2019;s College (Columbia University), where he excelled as both a student and as a leader. Hamilton&#x2019;s close relationship to George Washington, his friendships and conflicts with his fellow revolutionaries, and the rise and fall of his political star are all detailed, but it is his courtship of and marriage to the beautiful, vivacious Elizabeth Schuyler, a member of one of the oldest and most distinguished colonial families, that serves as the centerpiece of Cobbs&#x2019; page-turning historical novel. <b>Cobbs paints a portrait of a love so deep it was able to survive betrayal and a devastatingly public scandal.</b> The focus alternates between Alexander and Elizabeth as their tempestuous tale unfolds in all its triumph and tragedy.

Science often claims to explain nature without including God at all. And thinking Christians often feel forced to choose between the two. But the good news is that we don't have to make a choice. Science does not overthrow the Bible. Faith does not require rejecting science. World-renowned scientist Francis Collins, author of <em>The Language of God,</em> along with fellow scientist Karl Giberson show how we can embrace both. Their fascinating treatment explains how God cares for and interacts with his creation while science offers a reliable way to understand the world he made. Together they clearly answer dozens of the most common questions people ask about Darwin, evolution, the age of the earth, the Bible, the existence of God and our finely tuned universe. They also consider how their views stack up against the new atheists as well as against creationists and adherents of intelligent design. The authors disentangle the false conclusions of Christians and atheists alike about science and evolution from the actual results of research in astronomy, physics, geology and genetics. In its place they find a story of the grandeur and beauty of a world made by a supremely creative God.</p><p><strong>Karl W. Giberson</strong> (Ph.D.) is an internationally known scholar who serves as professor of physics at Eastern Nazarene College, is the director of the Forum on Faith and Science at Gordon College, and is executive vice president of The BioLogos Foundation.

He is director of the National Institutes of Health, founder of The BioLogos Foundation and author of the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <em>The Language of God.</em>"After all the shouting in this science/religion conflict, I appreciated the calm, respectful tone that characterizes <em>The Language of Science and Faith</em>." (LeRoy Lawson, Christian Standard, September 2012)<br><br>"We need more models like this that show us how to interact with the issues so that we will not continue to hypocritically take advantage of the advances of science while rejecting its foundational theories. Collins and Giberson are humble and gentle guides in this regard." (Amos Yong, The Pneuma Review, Summer 2012)<br><br>"In this informative and accessible book, [Giberson and Collins] answer many questions about evolution and its relation to Christian faith." (The Christian Century, May 2, 2012)<br><br>"This book should convince those sitting on or near the fence on questions of evolution and Christian belief. In this context, I heartily recommend <em>The Language of Science and Faith</em>." (Thomas Jay Oord, Studies in Religion/Sciences Religieuses, 40(4))<br><br>"This book will illuminate an under-exposed mind to methods of science oftentimes demonized. If nothing else, <em>The Language of Science and Faith</em> makes a great read and an excellence source of insight into a side of the creation-evolution debate not typically explored by evangelicals." (Cody Hamilton Nygard, The Baptist Standard, August 15, 2011)<br><br>"The authors disentangle the false conclusions of Christians and atheists alike about science and evolution from the actual results of research in astronomy, physics, geology and genetics. In its place they find a story of the grandeur and beauty of a world made by a supremely creative God." (Christian News, March 21, 2011)<br><br>"For too long, followers of Jesus have been told they have to make a choice&#x2015;between science and Christianity, reason and belief, their intellectual integrity and their faith. <em>The Language of Science and Faith</em> is a readable and comprehensive resource for the thoughtful Christian who refuses to choose. Giberson and Collins tackle difficult topics with charity, accessibility and integrity, moving the origins conversation forward in a way that honors God and builds up the church. This is a must-read for those who want to love the Lord with their heart, soul, mind and strength." (Rachel Held Evans, author of Evolving in Monkey Town)<br><br>"Collins and Giberson add a learned and engaging voice to the continuing struggle between Christian faith and scientific knowledge. The authors are central figures in advancing a true conversation between an ancient faith and modern ways of knowing, and it is hard to match their experience in dealing with the central questions covered in this volume. <em>The Language of Science and Faith</em> is an accessible distillation of their wisdom and I recommend it with great enthusiasm." (Peter Enns, Senior Fellow in Biblical Studies, The BioLogos Foundation)<br><br>"The theory of evolution raises important questions for Christians of all sorts, but this book is the best I've found to address the concerns of American evangelicals. It is written in clear enough language to be accessible to students at a variety of levels, yet sophisticated enough to be of interest to professionals in both science and theology. It is at once intelligent and inspiring." (Nancey Murphy, professor of Christian philosophy, Fuller Theological Seminary)<br><br>"Concise. Clear. Convincing.<em> The Language of Science and Faith</em> provides a straightforward means whereby the two sides of this contentious issue can get themselves on the same page. I recommend it as a resource for individuals and groups who want to believe that God speaks through both Scripture and nature." (Daniel M.

Readers approaching the epic for the first time will appreciate the translation's highly readable, poetic English as well as Conrad's informative Introduction and notes. Scholars will find the familiar heroes and heroines taking on new dimensions, secondary characters gaining increased prominence, and previously unknown figures emerging from obscurity.</p></p><p><p>David C. Conrad is Professor of History at the State University of New York, Oswego, and President of the Mande Studies Association.</p><p>Thanks to his careful editing and translating of Cond�'s narrative, Conrad offers a highly readable version of the epic that is about a third of its original length. The translation communicates not only the poetic qualities and the essential events of the Sunjata legend but also the master bard's performance values. Thus, this rendering will fascinate those who already know the story and culture and those coming to the epic for the first time. Conrad provides an excellent introduction to Mande oral tradition, the role of the <i>griot</i>, and the Manding belief system. Though he makes no claim for this as the complete scholarly edition, he does provide helpful scholarly notes, a glossary, and a good bibliography. . . . Summing up: Highly recommended. --L. W.

The underlying philosophy of the book is that early childhood educators&#x2019; most important task is to provide a program that is sensitive to and supports the development of young children. Author Eva L. Essa and new co-author Melissa Burnham provide valuable insight by strategically dividing the book into six sections that answer the "What, Who, Why, Where, and How" of early childhood education. Utilizing both NAEYC (National Association for the Education of Young Children) and DAP (Developmentally Appropriate Practice) standards, this supportive text provides readers with the skills, theories, and best practices needed to succeed and thrive as early childhood educators.</p><p><p><b>Dr. Eva Essa</b> is a retired professor of Human Development and Family Studies.

Though there is currently a large body of material on the theological interpretation of Scripture, most of it is highly specific and extremely technical. J. Todd Billings here provides a straightforward entryway for students and pastors to understand why theological interpretation matters and how it can be done. A solid, constructive theological work, <i>The Word of God for the People of God</i> presents a distinctive Trinitarian, participatory approach toward reading Scripture as the church. Billings's accessible yet substantial argument for a theological hermeneutic is rooted in a historic vision of the practice of scriptural interpretation even as it engages a wide range of contemporary issues and includes several exegetical examples that apply to concrete Christian ministry situations.</p><p>"This roadmap through the field of theological interpretation of Scripture is a feast for the mind and for the edification of the church."<br><b>Kevin Vanhoozer, Wheaton College Graduate School</b><br><br>"Simply marvelous. . . .

Lying pols.<br><br>Just a few of the snares lying in wait for the reporters who covered the 1972 presidential election. Traveling with the press pack from the June primaries to the big night in November, Rolling Stone reporter Timothy Crouse hopscotched the country with both the Nixon and McGovern campaigns and witnessed the birth of modern campaign journalism. The Boys on the Bus is the raucous story of how American news got to be what it is today. With its verve, wit, and psychological acumen, it is a classic of American reporting.</p><p>Political spin-doctoring has become something of an art form in the last few decades. It was less artful in the early years of the information age, and Crouse&#39;s entertaining look at the attempts of both the Nixon and McGovern &#39;72 campaign staffs to control the media seems almost comical, so poor were they at the image-and-sound bite manipulation that now defines our politics. Crouse is a serious-minded journalist, however, and his firsthand report on how political news is made and shaped remains important reading. Check out Hunter S.

Torch of Freedom, a previous Honorverse novel by David Weber and Eric Flint, was selected by Publishers Weekly as a Best Book of the Year, and both Torch of Freedom and Cauldron of Ghosts were New York Times bestsellers. Weber and his wife Sharon and their three children live in South Carolina.The fourth Honor Harrington novel is definitely the best in this increasingly popular military-sf series. Honor's old nemesis, Pavel Young, takes revenge on her for having him dismissed from the navy by hiring a duelist to kill her lover. This swiftly brings upon him a dire and vividly described fate, which puts Honor on half-pay on the planet Grayson, where she is a feudal magnate. Honor has always been as much a descendant of the Superperson as of C. S. Forester's very human Horatio Hornblower, but Weber has thought enough about her so that, when the time came to produce a character-driven military-sf novel, he could do so quite handsomely. That time is now, and these are a new Honor and a new Weber. With the war against the People's Republic of Haven clearly destined to last as long as the Napoleonic Wars after which it is modeled, expect to see more of both. <i>Roland Green</i></p><h2>Drawing the Living Figure (Dover Anatomy for Artists)</h2><p><p>"Joseph Sheppard has been favorably compared to practically every Renaissance master...he is without peer among modern realists for his ability to impart a warm verisimilitude to the figure." &#x2014; <i>Artspeak</i> magazine.<br>In this highly praised guidebook, Joseph Sheppard, a versatile and influential artist and teacher who is widely recognized as a master of figure drawing, introduces an innovative approach to drawing the human form. Beginning by reviewing the basics of anatomy, he makes his principal focus the specifics of surface anatomy.<br>Rather than depicting in detail the muscles and bone that lie beneath the skin, as do most books on artistic anatomy, this book concentrates on how the position and movement of muscles and bones affect the surface forms of live models. The effects are masterfully demonstrated in over 170 of Joseph Sheppard's own drawings of many different live models in front, back, and side views, and in various standing, sitting, kneeling, crouching, reclining, and twisting poses.<br>Each drawing is accompanied by two diagrams, one for bones, one for muscles, which specifically show how surface forms are created by the definitive shapes beneath the skin. The superb quality of Joseph Sheppard's drawings, the wide range of poses he illustrates, and the effectiveness of his approach in this book &#x2014; now in its first paperback edition &#x2014; will help artists at all levels improve and refine their skills in drawing the living figure.<br></p></p><p></p><h2>The Way to Nicaea V1 (Formation of Christian Theology) (Vol 1) (The Formation of Christian Theology, V. 1)</h2><p>This series traces the reflection provoked by Christ&#39;s question &#34;Who do you say I am?&#34; from the earliest days of Christianity to the Seventh Ecumenical Council.

Long passionate about the Civil War buff, she has studied theera avidly and has&nbsp;made many visits to Gettysburg,&nbsp; where she has witnessedreenactments of the legendary clash between North and South. Linda exploresthat turbulent time in <i>The Yankee Widow.</i><br><br>A fine sweat broke out between Hutch Carmody's shoulders and his gut warned that he was fixing to stumble straight into the teeth of a screeching buzz saw. The rented tux itched against his hide and his collar seemed to be getting tighter with every flower-scented breath he drew. The air was dense, weighted, cloying. The small church was overheated, especially for a sunny day in mid-June, and the pews were crammed with eager guests, a few weeping women and a fair number of skeptics.<br><br>Hutch's best man, Boone Taylor, fidgeted beside him.<br><br>The organist sounded a jarring chord and then launched into a perky tune Hutch didn't recognize. The first of three bridesmaids, all clad in silly-looking pink dresses more suited to little girls than grown women&#x2014;in his opinion anyhow&#x2014;drag-stepped her way up the aisle to stand beside the altar, across from him and Boone.<br><br>Hutch's head reeled, but he quickly reminded himself, silently of course, that he had to live in this town&#x2014;his ranch was just a few miles outside of it. If he passed out cold at his own wedding, he'd still be getting ribbed about it when he was ninety.<br><br>While the next bridesmaid started forward, he did his distracted best to avoid so much as glancing toward Brylee Parrish, his wife to be, who was standing at the back of the church beside her brother, Walker. He knew all too well how good she looked in that heirloom wedding gown of hers, with its billowing veil and dazzling sprinkle of rhinestones.<br><br>Brylee was beautiful, with cascades of red-brown hair that tumbled to her waist when she let it down. Her wide-set hazel eyes revealed passion, as well as formidable intelligence, humor and a country girl's in-born practicality.<br><br>He was a lucky man.<br><br>Brylee, on the other hand, was not so fortunate, having hooked up with the likes of him. She deserved a husband who loved her.<br><br>Suddenly, Hutch's gaze connected with that of his half brother, Slade Barlow. Seated near the front, next to his very pregnant wife, Joslyn, Slade slowly shook his head from side to side, his expression so solemn that a person would have thought somebody was about to be buried instead of hitched to one of the choicest women Parable County had ever produced.<br><br>Hutch's insides churned, then coalesced into a quivering gob and did a slow, backward roll.<br><br>The last bridesmaid had arrived.<br><br>The minister was in place.<br><br>The smell of the flowers intensified, nearly overwhelming Hutch.<br><br>And then the first notes of "Here Comes the Bride" rang out.<br><br>Hutch felt the room&#x2014;hell, the whole planet&#x2014;sway again.<br><br>Brylee, beaming behind the thin fabric of her veil, nodded in response to something her brother whispered to her and they stepped forward.<br><br>"Hold it," Hutch heard himself say loudly enough to be heard over the thundering joy of the organ. He held up both hands, like a referee about to call a foul in some fast-paced game. "Stop." everything halted&#x2014;with a sickening lurch.<br><br>The music died.<br><br>The bride and her brother seemed frozen in mid-stride.<br><br>Hutch would have sworn the universe itself had stopped expanding.<br><br>"This is all wrong," he went on miserably, but with his back straight and his head up. It wasn't as if he hadn't broached the subject with Brylee before&#x2014;he'd been trying to get out of this fix for weeks. Just the night before, in fact, he'd sat Brylee down in a vinyl upholstered booth at the Silver Lanes snack bar and told her straight out that he had serious misgivings about getting married and needed some breathing space.<br><br>Brylee had cried, her mascara smudging, her nose reddening at the tip.<br><br>"You don't mean it," she'd said, which was her standard response to any attempt he made to put on the brakes before they both plummeted over a matrimonial cliff. "You're just nervous, that's all. It's entirely normal. But once the wedding is over and we're on our honeymoon&#x2014;"<br><br>Hutch couldn't stand it when a woman cried, especially when he was the cause of her tears. Like every other time, he'd backed down, tried to convince himself that Brylee was right&#x2014;he just had cold feet, that was all.<br><br>Now, though, "push" had run smack up against "shove."<br><br>It was now or never.<br><br>He faced Brylee squarely.<br><br>The universe unfroze itself, like some big machine with rusted gears, and all hell broke loose.<br><br>Brylee threw down her bouquet, stomped on it once, whirled on one heel and rushed out of the church. Walker flung a beleaguered and not entirely friendly look in Hutch's direction, then turned to go after his sister.<br><br>The guests, already on their feet in honor of the bride, all started talking at once, abuzz with shock and speculation.<br><br>Things like this might happen in books or movies, but they <em>didn't</em> happen in Parable, Montana.<br><br>Until now, Hutch reflected dismally.<br><br>He started to follow Brylee out of the church, not an easy proposition with folks crowding the aisle. He didn't have the first clue what he could say to her, but he figured he had to say <em>something.</em><br><br>Before he'd taken two strides, though, Slade and Boone closed in on him from either side, each taking a firm grip on one of his arms.<br><br>"Let her go," Boone said quietly.<br><br>"There's nothing you can do," Slade confirmed.<br><br>With that, they hustled him quickly out of the main chapel and into the small side room where the choir robes, hymnals and Communion gear were stored.<br><br>Hutch wondered if a lynch mob was forming back there in the sanctuary.<br><br>"You picked a fine time to change your mind about getting married," Boone remarked, but his tone was light and his eyes twinkled with something that looked a lot like relief.<br><br>Hutch unfastened his fancy tie and shoved it into one coat pocket. Then he opened his collar halfway to his breastbone and sucked in a breath. "I tried to tell her," he muttered. He knew it sounded lame, but the truth was the truth.<br><br>Although he and Slade shared a father, they had been at bloody-knuckled odds most of their lives. They'd made some progress toward getting along since the old man's death and the upheaval that followed, but neither of them related to the other as a buddy, let alone a brother.<br><br>"Come on out to our place," Slade said, surprising him. "You'd best lay low for a few hours. Give Brylee&#x2014;and Walker&#x2014;a little time to cool off."<br><br>Hutch stiffened slightly, though he found the invitation oddly welcome. Home, being Whisper Creek Ranch, was a lonely outpost these days&#x2014;which was probably why he'd talked himself into proposing to Brylee in the first place.<br><br>"I have to talk to Brylee," he repeated.<br><br>"There'll be time for that later on," Slade reasoned.<br><br>"Slade's right," Boone agreed. Boone, being violently allergic to marriage himself, probably thought Hutch had just dodged a figurative bullet.<br><br>Or maybe he was remembering that Brylee was a crack shot with a pistol, a rifle, or a Civil War cannon.<br><br>Given what had just happened, she was probably leaning toward the cannon right about now.<br><br>Hutch sighed. "All right," he said to Slade. "I'll kick back at your place for a while&#x2014;but I've got to stop off at home first, so I can change out of this monkey suit."<br><br>"Fine," Slade agreed. "I'll round up the women and meet you at the Windfall in an hour or two."<br><br>By "the women," Slade meant his lovely wife, Joslyn, his teenage stepdaughter, Shea, and Opal Dennison, the force-of-nature who kept house for the Barlow outfit. Slade's mother, Callie, had had the good grace to skip the ceremony&#x2014;old scandals die hard in a town the size of Parable and recollections of her long-ago affair with Carmody Senior, from which Slade had famously resulted, were as sharp as ever.<br><br>Today's escapade would put all that in the shade, of course. Tongues were wagging and jaws were flapping for sure&#x2014;by now, various up-to-the-minute accounts were probably popping up on all the major social media sites. Before Slade and Boone had dragged Hutch out of the sanctuary, he'd seen several people whip out their cell phones and start texting. A few pictures had been taken, too, with those same ubiquitous devices.<br><br>The thought of all that amateur reporting made Hutch close his eyes for a moment. "Shit," he murmured.<br><br>"Knee-deep and rising," Slade confirmed, sounding resigned.<br><br>Kendra sat at the antique table in her best friend Joslyn's kitchen, with Callie Barlow in the chair directly across from hers. The ranch house was unusually quiet, with its usual occupants gone to town.<br><br>A glance over one shoulder assured Kendra that her recently adopted four-year-old daughter, Madison, was still napping on a padded window seat, her stuffed purple kangaroo, Rupert, clenched in her arms. The little girl's gleaming hair, the color of a newly minted penny, lay in tousled curls around her cherubic face and Ken-dra felt the usual pang of hopeless devotion just looking at her.<br><br>This long-sought, hard-won, much-wanted child. This miracle.<br><br>Not that every woman would have seen the situation from the same perspective as Kendra did&#x2014;Madison was, after all, living proof that Jeffrey had been unfaithful, a constant reminder that it was dangerous to love, treacherous to trust, foolish to believe in another person too much. But none of that had mattered to Kendra in the end&#x2014;she'd essentially been abandoned herself as a small child, left to grow up with a disinterested grandmother, and that gave her a special affinity for Madison. Besides, Jeffrey, having returned to his native England after summarily ending their marriage, had been dying.<br><br>Some men might have turned to family for help in such a situation&#x2014;Jeffrey Chamberlain came from a very wealthy and influential one&#x2014;but in this case, that wasn't possible. Jeffrey's aging parents were landed gentry with a string of titles, several sprawling estates and a fortune that dated back to the heyday of the East India Company, and were no more inclined toward child-rearing than they had been when their own two sons were small. They'd left Jeffrey and his brother in the care of nannies and housekeepers from infancy, and shipped them off to boarding school as soon as they turned six.<br><br>Understandably, Jeffrey hadn't wanted that kind of cold and isolated childhood for his daughter.<br><br>So he'd sent word to Kendra that he had to see her, in person. He had something important to tell her.<br><br>She'd made that first of several trips to the U.K., keeping protracted vigils at her ex-husband's hospital bedside while he drifted in and out of consciousness.<br><br>Eventually, he'd managed to get his message across: he told her about Madison, living somewhere in the U.S., and begged Kendra to find his daughter, adopt her and bring her up in love and safety. She was, he told her, the only person on earth he could or would trust with the child.<br><br>Kendra wanted nothing so much as a child and, during their brief marriage, Jeffrey had denied her repeated requests to start a family. It was a bitter pill to swallow, learning that he'd refused her a baby and then fathered one with someone else, someone he'd met on a business trip.<br><br>She'd done what Jeffrey asked, not so much for his sake&#x2014;though she'd loved him once, or believed she did&#x2014;as for Madison's. And her own.<br><br>The search hadn't been an easy one, even with the funds Jeffrey had set aside for the purpose, involving a great deal of web-surfing, phone calls and emails, travel and so many highs and lows that she nearly gave up several times.<br><br>Then it happened.

Kendra asked, instantly regretting the question but unable to hold back still another. "The wedding, I mean?"<br><br>Callie's smile was gentle as she glanced at the clock on the stove top and met Kendra's gaze again. "Probably," she said quietly. Then, without another word, she reached out to give Kendra's hand a light squeeze.<br><br>Madison, meanwhile, stirred on the window seat.<br><br>"Mommy?"<br><br>Kendra turned again. "I'm here, honey," she said.<br><br>Although Madison was adjusting rapidly, in the resilient way of young children, she still had bad dreams sometimes and she tended to panic if she lost sight of Kendra for more than a moment.<br><br>"Are you hungry, sweetie?" Callie asked the little girl. Slade's mom would make a wonderful grandmother; she had a way with children, easy and forthright.<br><br>Madison shook her head as she moved toward Ken-dra and then scrambled up onto her lap.<br><br>"It's been a while since lunch," Kendra suggested, kissing the top of Madison's head and holding her close.<br><br>"Maybe you'd like a glass of milk and one of Opal's oatmeal raisin cookies?"<br><br>Again, Madison shook her head, snuggling closer still.

Nathan Cabot Hale begins with the basic assumption that it is necessary for a sculptor-welder to have the same professional skills as a good job-welder. To help readers gain those skills, he demonstrates both traditional and comparatively new welding methods step by step, including the oxyacetylene technique in modeling small-scale figurative sculpture.<br>Mr. Hale first discusses the basic tools and techniques of welded sculpture, then addresses the construction of abstract and organic shapes and modeling solid figures. This is followed by detailed coverage of finishing techniques, arc welding, and welding large-scale commissioned works. He even dispenses helpful practical advice on the economics of fine art &#x2014; exhibiting work, staying alive, searching out public and private support, and more. <br>Over 80 helpful diagrams and more than 100 photographs accompany the text, demonstrating techniques and procedures&nbsp;and depicting works in progress as well as finished works. In a new chapter written specially for this edition, Mr. Hale shares the heartening artistic philosophy he has developed over his long and distinguished career.

These range from her first novel, <em>The Canada Geese Quilt, </em>an ALA Notable Book, to her popular picture book <em>The Bear That Heard Crying</em>.

She and her husband live in the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont.</p>Grade 2-5-This spare and moving chapter book will hook readers from the first page. Ruby Sawyer, born in 1912, has lived her whole life in a Vermont lumber camp, where she idolizes her Pa, a logger. Then he is killed in an accident, and Ruby, her Ma, and her 10 siblings must move to a small house near town. In the midst of her loneliness and sorrow, the 10-year-old meets Mrs. Graham, a kindly blind woman who lets Ruby read her books. When the child begins teaching some of the loggers to read, she is on the path to discovering her life's work. While the "lumber camp library" of the book's title is not established until nearly the last page, the narrative builds effectively to that point. This story is gentle enough for beginning readers without glossing over the more difficult details of Ruby's life. The novel is long enough to get readers involved, but moves along quickly enough to hold their interest, and they will be transfixed by the strong and spirited Ruby.<br><i>Kristen Oravec, Cuyahoga County Public Library, Strongsville, OH</i><br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Graveyard of Memories (A John Rain Novel)</h2><p><p>What makes a legendary assassin?

But the Gbaba can detect the emissions of an industrial civilization, so the human rulers of Safehold have taken extraordinary measures: with mind control and hidden high technology, they've built a religion in which <i>every</i> Safeholdian believes, a religion designed to keep Safehold society medieval forever.</p><p>800 years pass. In a hidden chamber on Safehold, an android from the far human past awakens. This "rebirth" was set in motion centuries before, by a faction that opposed shackling humanity with a concocted religion. Via automated recordings, "Nimue" - or, rather, the android with the memories of Lieutenant Commander Nimue Alban - is told her fate: she will emerge into Safeholdian society, suitably disguised, and begin the process of provoking the technological progress which the Church of God Awaiting has worked for centuries to prevent. </p><p>Nothing about this will be easy. To better deal with a medieval society, "Nimue" takes a new gender and a new name, "Merlin." His formidable powers and access to caches of hidden high technology will need to be carefully concealed.

Now the end had finally come; Earth herself lay under siege by an enemy humankind could not defeat.<br><br>And so mankind undertook one last throw of the dice: Operation Ark. Earth&#x2019;s final colonizing expedition was meant to build a new civilization, on a planet so distant even the Gbaba might never find it, and without the high-tech infrastructure whose emissions might betray its location. To protect and conceal that expedition, the Navy&#x2019;s final fleet was prepared to die to the last ship. Lieutenant Commander Nimue Alban volunteered to serve on the flagship of that fleet, knowing that she and everyone else aboard it would die...which was exactly what happened.<br><br>So she was a little surprised to wake up in a cave on a planet called Safehold. She was even more surprised to discover that she&#x2019;d been dead for eight centuries...and that the fanatic administrators of Operation Ark had used mind control techniques to create a false, brutally suppressive religion in which every single Safeholdian believed. One whose entire purpose was to forbid invention and innovation forever. <br><br>Everyone on Safehold knows the Church is the consecrated custodian of God&#x2019;s will. Everyone knows forbidden technology is the work of the Devil. And everyone knows that anyone who dabbles in the forbidden must be destroyed, lest everyone&#x2019;s soul be lost forever to damnation.<br><br>But a tiny fraction within Operation Ark&#x2019;s leadership remembered the truth and believed in human dignity and freedom. They&#x2019;ve left Nimue Alban to oppose that monstrous creation, and they&#x2019;ve given her a carefully hidden cache of technology and the capabilities of the android body in which her memories, loves, hopes, and dreams live on. It&#x2019;s her job to somehow provoke the that human progress which the Church of God Awaiting has worked centuries to crush. <br><br>Now, in a new guise&#x2014;that of the apparently male &#x201c;Merlin&#x201d;--Nimue comes to Charis, a mid-sized kingdom with a talent for naval warfare, to make the acquaintance of King Haarahld and Crown Prince Cayleb, and maybe, just maybe, kick off a new era of invention. In this excerpt, Merlin, having managed to save Cayleb from an attempted assassination, speaks with King Haarahld for the first time...<br><br><strong><strong>.VI.</strong><br><br><strong><em>Royal</em></strong></strong><strong><strong><em>Palace</em></strong><strong><em>, Telesberg,</em></strong></strong><br><strong><br><strong><em>Kingdom</em></strong><strong><em>of </em></strong><strong><em>Charis</em></strong></strong><strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>Seijin </em>Merlin, Your Majesty,&#x201c; the chamberlain said quietly as he stepped through the open doorway and bowed. Merlin followed him into the small presence chamber -- more of a working office, really, it seemed -- and bowed a bit more profoundly than the chamberlain. King Haarahld&#x2019;s court was looked down upon by the courtiers of such sophisticated lands as Harchong because of its casual informality and ability to get along without a veritable horde of servitors. Still, Haarahld was a king, and one of the more powerful ones on the face of Safehold, whatever others might think.<br><br>&#x201c;<em>Seijin</em>,&#x201c; Haarahld said, and Merlin looked up.<br><br>He saw a man of middle years, stocky, for a Charisian, and taller than most, although shorter than his son and considerably shorter than Merlin. Haarahld wore the traditional loose-cut breeches and thigh-length linen over-tunic of the Charisian upperclass, although <em>his</em>tunic was bright with bullion embroidery and bead work. The belt about his waist was made of intricately decorated, seashell-shaped plaques of hammered silver, the golden scepter badge of one who&#x2019;d made his required pilgrimage to the Temple gleamed on his shoulder brooch, and the glittering fire of the emerald-set golden chain which was his normal badge of office glowed upon his chest. He had a neatly trimmed beard, somewhat more luxuriant than Merlin&#x2019;s own, and the slight epicanthic fold common to most of Safehold&#x2019;s humanity. <br><br>Haarahld VII was fifty-two local years old, just over forty-seven standard, and he&#x2019;d sat on his throne for just over twenty local years. In that time, he&#x2019;d come to be known -- by his own subjects, at least -- as &#x201c;Haarahld the Just,&#x201c; and his level eyes considered Merlin thoughtfully. He was putting on a bit of extra flesh these days, Merlin noticed. Judging from his chest and shoulders, he&#x2019;d been a man of heroic physique in his youth, but maintaining that sort of fitness, especially at his age, must have been the next best thing to impossible given his immobile right knee. His leg stretched out straight in front of him, his heel resting on a footrest, as he sat in a comfortable but not particularly splendid armchair behind a desk cluttered with documents and slates.<br><br>One other person was present. A bishop of the Church of God Awaiting with silvering dark hair and a splendid patriarchal beard, stood at the king&#x2019;s right shoulder. His three-cornered cap bore the white cockade of a senior bishop, but lacked the ribbon of an archbishop. His eyes were bright as they considered Merlin, and his white cassock bore the oil lamp emblem of the Order of B�dard. <br><br>The sight of that lamp set Merlin&#x2019;s teeth instantly on edge, but he made himself suppress the instinctive reaction firmly. Much as he hated to admit it, the order which bore Ador�e B�dard&#x2019;s name had changed over the years into something far different from anything its ostensible patron would have wanted to see. Besides, he&#x2019;d &#x201c;seen&#x201d; this bishop often enough through his SNARCs to strongly suspect what impelled Haarahld to trust him so totally.<br><br>&#x201c;Your Majesty,&#x201c; he murmured in reply to the king&#x2019;s greeting after only the briefest of pauses. &#x201c;You do me honor to receive me privately.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Perhaps,&#x201c; Haarahld said, studying his visitor intently. &#x201c;Some might feel I&#x2019;ve slighted you by not greeting you and thanking you for my son&#x2019;s life in a more public audience.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But at that more public audience, Your Majesty, I would undoubtedly have been uncomfortably aware of all of the spanned crossbows watching me so alertly. Here,&#x201c; Merlin smiled charmingly, &#x201c;I need worry only about the two bodyguards behind that screen.&#x201d;<br><br>He nodded towards the exquisitely detailed lacquered Harchongese screen behind the king, and Haarahld&#x2019;s eyes narrowed. The bishop&#x2019;s, however, only considered Merlin with a sort of calm curiosity.<br><br>Interesting, Merlin thought, but his attention was mainly focused on the king, waiting for <em>his</em>reaction. Which came after a heartbeat in a single word.<br><br>&#x201c;Indeed?&#x201d; Haarahld said, and Merlin smiled again.<br><br>&#x201c;This is Thursday, Your Majesty. Assuming you&#x2019;ve stuck to your regular duty schedule, it should be Sergeant Haarpar and Sergeant Gahrdaner.&#x201d;<br><br>The chamberlain stepped quickly to one side, right hand falling to the dagger sheathed at his hip, the bishop touched the golden scepter of Langhorne hanging upon his breast, and even Haarahld sat up straighter in his chair. But the king also raised one hand, and shook his head sharply at the chamberlain.<br><br>&#x201c;No, Pawal,&#x201c; he said. &#x201c;After all, our guest <em>is </em>a <em>seijin</em>, is he not?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Or something else, Sire,&#x201c; the chamberlain said darkly. He glowered at Merlin with eyes full of suspicion, and his hand left his dagger hilt only reluctantly.<br><br>&#x201c;Your Majesty,&#x201c; Merlin said, &#x201c;my weapons have all been left in my chamber. Your guardsmen were extremely courteous, but they also searched me very carefully before permitting me into your presence. Surely, one unarmed man is no threat to a monarch whose servants are as loyal to him as yours are to you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Somehow, <em>Seijin </em>Merlin, I doubt a man such as you is ever unarmed, as long as he has his brain,&#x201c; Haarahld said with a slow, appreciative smile of his own.<br><br>&#x201c;One tries, Your Majesty,&#x201c; Merlin conceded.<br><br>The bishop&#x2019;s lips twitched in what might almost have been a stillborn smile, and Haarahld leaned back in his chair once more, considering the blue-eyed stranger even more thoughtfully than before. Then he nodded and looked at the chamberlain.<br><br>&#x201c;Pawal, I believe we might offer <em>Seijin </em>Merlin a chair.&#x201d;<br><br>Pawal Hahlmahn looked moderately outraged, but he also carrieda straight-backed but upholstered chair from the corner of the room and set it down facing Haarahld&#x2019;s desk.<br><br>&#x201c;Please,<em>Seijin</em>,&#x201c; Haarahld invited. &#x201c;Be seated.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you, Your Majesty.&#x201d;<br><br>Merlin settled into the chair and cocked his head, his eyebrows raised.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,<em>Seijin</em>,&#x201c; Haarahld said with a suspiciously grin-like smile, &#x201c;the interrogation will now begin.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m at your service, Your Majesty.&#x201d; Merlin inclined his head again, politely, and Haarahld chuckled.<br><br>&#x201c;I find that difficult to believe,<em>Seijin</em>,&#x201c; he said. &#x201c;Somehow, I have the distinct impression that it&#x2019;s more a case of Charis finding herself at <em>your </em>service.&#x201d;<br><br>Merlin smiled, but behind that smile he winced. Haarahld VII, in person, was even more impressive than he&#x2019;d been observed from afar via SNARC.<br><br>&#x201c;Before we begin,&#x201c; Haarahld said more seriou...</strong></strong></p></p><h2>Everything But the Burden: What White People Are Taking from Black Culture</h2><p>White kids from the &#x2019;burbs are throwing up gang signs. The 2001 Grammy winner for best rap artist was as white as rice. And blond-haired sorority sisters are sporting FUBU gear. What is going on in American culture that&#x2019;s giving our nation a racial-identity crisis?<br><b><br></b>Following the trail blazed by Norman Mailer&#x2019;s controversial essay &#x201c;The White Negro,&#x201d; <i>Everything but the Burden</i> brings together voices from music, popular culture, the literary world, and the media speaking about how from Brooklyn to the Badlands white people are co-opting black styles of music, dance, dress, and slang. In this collection, the essayists examine how whites seem to be taking on, as editor Greg Tate&#x2019;s mother used to tell him, &#x201c;everything but the burden&#x201d;&#x2013;from fetishizing black athletes to spinning the ghetto lifestyle into a glamorous commodity. Is this a way of shaking off the fear of the unknown? A flattering indicator of appreciation? Or is it a more complicated cultural exchange?

Whatever else Black Americans may be we have defined the past. It is our experience with capture, enslavement, emancipation, segregation, and redemption that will celebrate this living and save our souls. We will define the future. It is our willingness to forgive that both perplexes and confounds those who think they can braid their hair or drop their pants and know something about the splendor of being who we are. <b>EVERYTHING BUT THE BURDEN </b>looks through both a telescope and a mirror. The images reflect and rebound. Sure they will take Gaye's anguish and make a commercial out of it for Radio Shack just like they took So You Want a Revolution to tell you to buy Nikes. But we're still here, still laughing, still loving, still deciding what looks good and what sounds right. We're still hugging ourselves, still making joyful noise. Still finding a way to be human and humane.

Drawing from countless conversations with hundreds of mothers spanning more than a decade, What Mothers Do provides lucid insight into the true experience of motherhood and answers the perennial question common to mothers everywhere: What have I <i>done</i> all day? <br><br> Stadlen's wise reflections, threaded throughout with the voices of real mothers, explore unsentimental reactions to motherhood-resentment, guilt, splintered identity, crippling inefficiency, and deadening fatigue. Yet the overriding sentiment is one of empowerment and wonder, as Stadlen illustrates how seemingly insignificant skills such as responding to a baby's colicky cry, being instantly interruptible, or soothing an overstimulated child to sleep profoundly contribute to an individual's socialization, self-worth, and curiosity. Remarkably perceptive and heartening, What Mothers Do will resonate with mothers everywhere in search of understanding and wisdom.</p><p><b>Naomi Stadlen</b> has had the unique experience of listening to hundreds of mothers talk about their experiences, both in her weekly discussion group Mothers Talking, which she founded more than 15 years ago at the Active Birth Centre in London, and in her private practice as a psychotherapist specializing in parenting. A breastfeeding counselor for La Leche League, Stadlen is the mother of three adult children and has a grandson.Stadlen presents a heartfelt and incisive examination of mothers' inner lives, revealing the vital worth of quiet (and not so quiet) time devoted to a baby. A psychotherapist specializing in parenting issues, founder of the London-based weekly discussion group Mothers Talking, and a La Leche League breastfeeding counselor, the author quotes a range of mothers throughout, exploring their feelings about their roles as nurturers and caregivers. She notes that though these women may often feel lonely, invisible and unimportant, "the whole of civilization depends on the work of mothers." Still, she writes, many women (and men) are unprepared for their responsibilities as parents; although they put much effort into readying for birth, many are anxious and confused as well as shocked and exhausted when it comes to actually raising a child. Stadlen gives credit to the women who slow their days to match their baby's pace, become continuously "interruptible" and offer constant and unconditional love. Though the narrative meanders at times, mothers will relate to the voices of the women, and take comfort in Stadlen's kudos. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Lakeside seemed like the answer, that&#x2019;s for sure, but what was the question?<br><br>What kind of void can there be in the life of a thirteen-�year-�old boy that requires a shopping center to fill it? Why would a lad growing up in Essex in the eighties have a yearning to shop that would be a more probable endowment of one the gals from Sex and the City?<br><br>Joseph Campbell, the cultural anthropologist who I&#x2019;ll be banging on about a lot in this book, said, &#x201c;If you want to understand what&#x2019;s most important to a society, don&#x2019;t examine its art or literature, simply look at its biggest buildings.&#x201d; In medieval societies, the biggest buildings were its churches and palaces; using Campbell&#x2019;s method, we can assume these were feudal cultures that revered their leaders and worshipped God. In modern Western cities, the biggest buildings are the banks&#x2014;�bloody great towers that dominate the docklands&#x2014;�and the shopping centers, which architecturally ape the cathedrals they&#x2019;ve replaced: domes, spires, eerie celestial calm, fountains for fonts, food courts for pews. If you were to ask the developers of Lakeside or any shopping center what they are offering consumers (formerly known as &#x201c;people&#x201d;) they&#x2019;d say, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all under one roof&#x201d;&#x2014;�great, a ceiling, and, more importantly, &#x201c;choice.&#x201d; Choice is the key. Apparently, then, what excited me as a bulimic Smiths fan and onanist was the possibility of choice, and for anybody to be stimulated by the idea of choice, the precondition must be a lack of choice. Which is a way of saying a lack of power, a lack of freedom.<br><br>I&#x2019;m not inferring that we need to revert to a medieval culture, by the way, all bubonic and snaggletoothed with shabbily bandaged hands, chewing on a turnip, genuflecting in a ditch as a baron sweeps by on horseback. If we&#x2019;ve learned anything from Blackadder, it&#x2019;s that history was a shit-�hole.<br><br>What I believe is that we&#x2019;re only just beginning to understand the incredible capacity of human beings, that we can become something unrecognizable, that we can have true freedom, not some tantalizing emblem forever out of reach. Not weary compromise and nagging fear.<br><br>I used to believe in the system that I was born into: aspire, acquire, consume, get famous and glamorous, get high and mighty, get paid and laid. I saw what was being offered in wipe-�clean magazines and silver screens, and I signed up. I wanted choice, freedom, power, sex, and drugs, and I&#x2019;ve used them and they&#x2019;ve used me.<br><br>&#x201c;Why would you be satisfied with the scraps of fame and fortune, of sex and distraction?&#x201d; asked a fellow recovering drunk that I was chatting to in New Orleans. He was well tanned&#x2014;�in an overly literal way, the way leather is tanned&#x2014;�his skin coarse and lined, his beard gripped his face like a furry fist. His shirt had faded stains and rings, like coffee-�cup marks on an old map. He looked like a man who had lived, who&#x2019;d had long nights and fistfights, but his eyes were as clear as his words.<br><br>&#x201c;Money, fame&#x2014;�those are the crumbs,&#x201d; he said, brushing the words away with his thick forearm. &#x201c;I want to be at the banquet.&#x201d; At this last he looked up and smiled. Then he strolled off with brutish majesty to do volunteer work with the plentiful New Orleans homeless. In retrospect, his departure was melodramatic, like a grass in a police drama swanning off after a midnight subterranean confab with his cop handler, maybe grinding out a fag, then leaving&#x2014;�why don&#x2019;t they ever say, &#x201c;Well, I better be off, then; toodle-�oo,&#x201d; like normal people?<br><br>The most positive thing about being a drug addict is that it calcifies your disillusion; someone else, also a drunk&#x2014;�I&#x2019;m starting to think I spend too much time listening to these lushes&#x2014;�said to me, &#x201c;Drugs and alcohol are not our problem, reality is our problem; drugs and alcohol are our solution to that problem.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s a very smart way of putting it.<br><br>The same impulse that made Lakeside seem a good idea to me also made heroin seem like a good idea. That might seem like a radical corollary to offer, but it isn&#x2019;t. When I was a kid in Grays I was aware of an emptiness, a sadness, a nameless sense of disconnection, so when it was suggested by a local paper, a local politician, a mayor or whatever, that Lakeside might be the answer, I suppose I thought, &#x201c;Yes, Lakeside might be the answer.&#x201d; Given that I subsequently went on to become addicted to anything that could be cooked, snorted, or swallowed, it seems Lakeside&#x2019;s palliative qualities were at best limited. Perhaps I&#x2019;m an extreme case. But isn&#x2019;t that all addiction really is, &#x201c;an extreme case&#x201d;?<br><br>Aren&#x2019;t we all, in one way or another, trying to find a solution to the problem of reality? If I get this job, this girl, this guy, these shoes. If I pass this exam, eat this pizza, drink this booze, go on this holiday. Learn karate, learn yoga. If West Ham stay up, if my dick stays up, if I get more likes on Facebook, more fancy cookbooks, a better kitchen, cure this itchin&#x2019;, if she stops bitching.<br><br>Isn&#x2019;t there always some kind of condition to contentment? Isn&#x2019;t it always placed in the future, wrapped up in some object, either physical or ideological? I know for me it is, and as an addict that always leads me to excess and then to trouble.<br><br>Do you feel like that? Are you looking for something? It&#x2019;s not just me, is it? Do you sometimes feel afraid, self-�conscious, lonely, not good enough? I mean, you&#x2019;re reading this, so you must want to change something.<br><br>Don&#x2019;t leave me out on a limb, all vulnerable and exposed. Are you reading this on a yacht, through your Ray-�Bans with, I dunno, a pair of glistening Russian sisters and a gob oozing with lobster juice as the sun shines down on you and the sisters smile up at you? And even if you are, �especially if you are, is it working? Behind the salty tang and priapic pang, is it real, is it real, is it like God is holding your hand?<br><br>I mean, I&#x2019;ve tried decadence too. I lived in a Hollywood mansion, I went to the Oscars, I hosted big dos.<br><br>In 2002, at two weeks clean, in a Bury St. Edmunds B&amp;B on Christmas Eve, watching TV, perched on a single bed with my mum, both of us with the glum cordiality of an A&amp;E waiting room&#x2014;�shell-�shocked smiles and no hope&#x2014;�if some twinkling superficial fairy had flown in and said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be taking your mum to the Oscars in a few years, don&#x2019;t worry,&#x201d; I&#x2019;d obviously&#x2019;ve been surprised (I mean, a fairy), but what would&#x2019;ve been incomprehensible to me would&#x2019;ve been the veracious addition from the ethereal intruder that &#x201c;Oh, by the way, you&#x2019;ll both find the Oscars fucking boring.&#x201d;<br><br>Lakeside is a local parish; Hollywood is the Vatican. I wondered how the other parishioners had fared when I went back to Grays recently. I wondered whether Lakeside had delivered for the people I grew up with, the people I left behind, the people I was running from; I wondered if they got their choice, freedom and opportunity.<br><br>I fare-�dodged my way out of Grays on the Fenchurch Street train, which primarily transports commuting city workers from Essex to the City of London. Stopping at Chafford Hundred&#x2014;�the new estate they built opposite the street where I grew up&#x2014;�Purfleet, Lakeside, Rainham, Dagenham Dock, Barking, and Limehouse. I&#x2019;d hide in the toilet under my gelled quiff, with my own &#x201c;Out of Order&#x201d; sign on the door, a cross between Del Boy and Matt Goss, puffing skunk, counting stops.<br><br>Now I glide in the back of Mick&#x2019;s Mercedes. Mick would be &#x201c;my driver&#x201d; if I employed possessive determiners before people and if he exhibited a modicum of professionalism. Instead, he is my mate, who drives me. It is still, of course, in reality a long way from where I am from&#x2014;�child of a single mum, on benefits, drug addicted&#x2014;as we journey down the A13 past the disused Ford factory where my nan&#x2019;s husband, Bert, worked, past the marshes where there was talk of building Euro Disney. I was naturally devastated when they went for Paris instead&#x2014;�I mean, fucking Paris?! Walt must be spinning in his grave, or cryogenic chamber, or wherever the hell it is they keep his brilliant Nazi corpse.<br><br>The reason for this trip down memory lane&#x2014;�or memory pain as I tend to call it, because my past is soaked in misery and rejection; it rejected me, then I rejected it&#x2014;�is that my schoolfriend Sam asked me to open a Mind shop. Mind is the a mental-�health charity that he works for, and I, with my history of mental illness, plus the fact that he&#x2019;s a mate and the irresistible pun &#x201c;open your Mind (shop), man,&#x201d; feel it&#x2019;s worth risking a visit to the scene of the crime. The crime of being born, which is the manner I regarded my birth as a troubled and troubling adolescent.<br><br>Grays wasn&#x2019;t great when I grew up, but a lot of that might&#x2019;ve been because I was looking at it from inside my head and I reckon I could&#x2019;ve been reared in Tuscany and rendered it a tragedy, the way my nut operated. I had a tendency for misery. What Grays is and was&#x2014;�and as the name suggests, aside from my self-�aggrandizing melancholy&#x2014;�is a normal town. You could say a normal, suburban, Essex town; you could say a normal British town, or a normal northern European town, or even a normal town in a secular, Western democracy.<br><br>When I was a kid, that meant the town center, where I was due to &#x201c;open your Mind, man&#x201d;, had a market, chain stores, and local businesses. People did their shopping there, hung out&#x2014;�you know, normal stuff. When I disembarked from my tinted capsule of privilege, I was shocked to see how much Grays has changed. I mean, we&#x2019;re not describing the sacking of Rome here, not the desecration of the sacred treasures of a glorious city-�state, it was always a bit of a dump, but the chain stores were gone, the local businesses were gone, and the market had shut down.<br><br>Now there were pound shops, betting shops, charity shops, and off-�licenses. The people of the town I&#x2019;d left twenty years ago were different: More of them were drunk; more of them were visibly undernourished&#x2014;�more than that, though, I could feel that there was a despondency among the fifty or so folk assembled with listless anticipation around the barrier outside the Mind shop.<br><br>The more callous among you might say that was as a result of my impending visit, you swines, but it wasn&#x2019;t that. Something had been taken from them, and I could feel its absence. More shocking though than this sad deterioration is that Grays, this lesser, depleted Grays with its food banks, Wonga loans, and escalating addiction problem, is still normal.<br><br>This is happening everywhere. The richest 1 percent of British people have as much as the poorest 55 percent. Some people like me were in the 55 percent and are now in the 1 percent, but, mostly, normal people are getting poorer. Globally it&#x2019;s worse. Oxfam say a bus with the eighty-�five richest people in the world on it would contain more wealth than the collective assets of half the earth&#x2019;s population&#x2014;�that&#x2019;s three and a half billion people.<br><br>Though I can&#x2019;t imagine they&#x2019;d be getting on a bus with that kind of money or be hanging out together, I bet there&#x2019;d be a lot of tension, jealousy, and petty bickering on that bus:<br><br>&#x201c;My corporation is bigger than your corporation.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah? I&#x2019;ve got my own media network!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;YEAH!? I&#x2019;ve got an elite organization that controls global politics.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Stop this bus. I want to return to my subaquatic palace with my half-�fish brides and sing a song about the supremacy of marine life.&#x201d;<br><br>The last example might be from the Disney film The Little Mermaid. Walt&#x2019;s frozen noggin is definitely on that bus.<br><br>In America, a country that, let&#x2019;s face it, has really run with this whole capitalism thing, the six heirs to the Walmart fortune have more wealth than the poorest 30 percent of Americans. There&#x2019;s six of them! They can&#x2019;t even form a football team, how are they going to stop a revolution when we act on the unfairness of that statistic? Unless the entire system is rigged to maneuver wealth to an elite group of people, then ensure that it remains there.<br><br>What you just read is crazy. Insane. Unbelievable but true. As real as your hands that are holding this book (Kindle/tablet/ intra-�neural-�brain hologram, if it&#x2019;s really far in the future), that information is as real as the breath that you are inhaling.<br><br>Six people whose dad was &#x201c;good at supermarkets&#x201d; have more money than hundreds of millions of struggling Americans. A bus full of plutocrats, royals, and oligarchs have as much money as every refugee, war child, and potbellied, rough-�sleeping person on the planet.<br><br>You can hear that is crazy, you can see that it&#x2019;s wrong, you feel that this is beyond disturbing. We&#x2019;re told there&#x2019;s nothing we can do about it, that this is &#x201c;the way things are.&#x201d; Naturally, of course, that verdict emanates from the elite institutions, organizations, and individuals that benefit from things being &#x201c;the way they are.&#x201d;<br><br>More important, perhaps, than this galling inequality is the fact that we have a limited amount of time to resolve it. The same interests that benefit from this&#x2014;�for brevity I&#x2019;m going to say &#x201c;system&#x201d;&#x2014;�need, in order to maintain it, to deplete the earth&#x2019;s resources so rapidly, violently, and irresponsibly that our planet&#x2019;s ability to support human life is being threatened. This is also pretty fucked up.<br><br>I mean, if someone said they had a socio-economic system that creates a hugely wealthy elite at the cost of everyone else but it was ecologically sound, we&#x2019;d tell them to fuck off. What we&#x2019;ve got is one that is systematically inflating the wealth of the elite, rapidly suffocating everybody else, and it&#x2019;s destroying the planet that we all live on. I know you already know this. I know. We all know. But it&#x2019;s so absurd&#x2014;�psychopathic, in fact&#x2014;�that we obviously need to reiterate it.<br><br>These elites, these loonies on the diamond-�encrusted fun bus, they live on the planet with us, they&#x2019;re basically the same as us. So they&#x2019;re in trouble too&#x2014;�unless this bus is equipped for space travel and they plan to wait until the earth is a scorched husk, then blast off to a moon base.<br><br>As I perused the new shelves beari...</p><h2>The Bay of Noon: A Novel</h2><p><p><b>Long out of print, Shirley Hazzard's classic novel of love and memory</b></p><p>A young Englishwoman working in Naples, Jenny comes to Italy fleeing a history that threatened to undo her.

The plane had taken off from Naples in fog; some hours afterwards it was reported missing. The search went on for hundreds of miles around - over the Ionian Sea, and at Catania, at Catanzaro. Two days later, when the fog lifted, we could see the wreck quite clearly, crumbled against the snow-streaked cone of the volcano, overlooking the airfield from which it had set out. No one had thought of looking close to home. Since that time, so they say, we have developed better methods of keeping in touch. For it is twelve or fifteen years, now, since the accident took place. When I was a child I used to be filled with envy when adults recalled events of twelve or fifteen years before. I would think it must be marvellous, to issue those proclamations of experience - 'It was at least ten years ago', or 'I hadn't seen him for twenty years'. But chronological prestige is tenacious: once attained, it can't be shed; it increases moment by moment, day by day, pressing its honours on you until you are lavishly, overly endowed with them. Until you literally sink under them. A centenarian has told me that memory protects one from this burden of experience. Whole segments of time droppedout, she said: 'Of five or six years, say, around the turn of the century, all I can remember is the dress that someone wore, or the colour of a curtain.' And I would be pleased, rather than otherwise, at the prospect of remembering Naples in similar terms - a lilac dress Gioconda wore one morning driving to Caserta, or the Siena-coloured curtains of the apartment in San Biagio dei Librai. But memory, at an interval of only fifteen years, is less economical and less poetic, still clouded with effects and what seemed to be their causes. The search is still under way in unlikely places - too assiduous, too attenuated; too far from home. There was then, there is still, a big NATO establishment at Naples organized around the United States Sixth Fleet, with token components from other countries. When I was brought there from London to translate documents from Italian into English and to do some clerical sifting and sorting of coloured papers, there were already a number of English girls at the base doing similar things - Angelas and Hilarys and Rosemarys who had wanted to get away from Reading or Ruislip or Holland Park. For the most part those fugitive girls were in their twenties; and over them hung an immanence, a pale expectancy, as if their youth were yet to come to them. What passion they possessed for change had, in getting them to Naples, expended itself; once there, they relapsed into their natural obligingness. Breathlessly polite, they made among the drab or primary colours of military life their tender, uncherished strokes of pastel. My work, though much like theirs, took place in a different building; my life, while no more nourishing, had been lived on a different continent. I had spent the war out of England. Although I was a child when that took place, there was always an implication to it, if not of defection at least of something regrettable. Even my brother used to say, 'Jenny spent the war in Africa,' in a way that at once apologized for and excluded me. I arrived at Naples in autumn, a belatedly inserted item on the budget of a joint mission to study docking and airport facilities with a view to extending them. With a view to extending them, for no such mission ever pronounced the existing state of affairs to be adequate. The airfield - the same airfield that lay to the south, at the foot of the volcano, far from our offices - was to be, for example, enlarged to receive jet planes, which were coming into military use then. In addition, there were rockets, there were higher and higher explosives, there was the prospect of the nuclear submarine. Even in London where over translations of preliminary papers I learnt the terms I had never in either language known, it seemed implausible that such responsibilities should have devolved on Naples. Ignorant of the Mediterranean, hesitantly speaking an Italian sporadically acquired in Somaliland, I prepared to take the city's part with the loyalty of the native-born. Our offices were part of a modern complex at Bagnoli, on the northern outskirts of Naples. Modern, I say, but the buildings now have dated in a remarkable way: it is their characterlessness that identifies them, and their resolute unawareness of place. In and around those buildings thousands of NATO personnel and their families lived out their term of exile, requiring nothing of Italy or its language, passing among themselves stale, trumpery talismans of home, recreating a former existence from the shelves of the PX until such time as they should - on other, equally alien shores - speak with nostalgia and authority of the Bay of Naples. Having arrived with the advance segment of the mission, I was installed along with them - by one of those errors that are the mark of the highly organized - into a hotel in Naples itself, one of the good hotels on the seafront. It was error, then, that set me apart from the first. In the early weeks, when a car fetched us from the hotel before it was light and brought us home each evening after dark, when orders obliged us to idleweek-ends away in our empty office, we did not live in Naples so much as merely sleep in it. Yet I waited for the city, and its intervention, much in the way that those pale companions of mine awaited life itself. &nbsp; <br> In the fourth week I was lent - was detailed, as they said, for military precision runs to many syllables - for the day to a British civilian. A marine biologist having letters from Whitehall, he too needed pages translated while he waited for the Naples Aquarium to take him under what my Colonel repeatedly and delightedly called its wing. In the office next to ours a telephone was put down, a name was called. The name was out, sick with a virus; for it, mine was substituted. The following morning I did not take the car - the Vehicle, as the Colonel called it - in the dark to Bagnoli, but walked in winter sunshine the few steps from the Hotel Vesuvio to the Hotel Royal, and sent up my name through the concierge. Of the morning I remember little: sitting with a pad and pencil in a glassed-in, blue-rugged hotel room - a room that was not, with its aquatic reflections, unlike an aquarium in itself - turning my eyes time and again to the bay; seeing it, because of what I was writing about, not as a blue surface filling a curve of land but as a dense and teeming jungle in which weeds and rocks and wrecks and a million creatures reproduced in strange counter-part the city of Naples itself. Echinoderms, I wrote of, and the Mysidae and the Squillidae, and compiled a list of publications on the Mollusca - these unknowns appearing more familiar in kind than did the accustomed daily litanies of troops and mat�riel; just as my companion, civil and aloof, seemed more compatible than the sullen hearties of the base. The work went quickly; it was not yet noon when my scientist gave up his silent assembling of the papers that were divided into rows across his bed, and said, 'You have caught me up.' With a wad of completed pages in my hand, I rose - to show willing, a sort of coming to attention. He took the finished sheets and put them in a folder without checking them - a courtesy, I thought, like not seeming to count one's change. 'Can you go and play for a while? I have to put the next lot together, and something is missing. Could you be back here, say, at three?' In this way I was set at liberty, and left the hotel as full of joyful purpose as if I had been going to an assignation. Until then I had not been once in the city in the middle of the day. But after weeks of surveillance the sense of freedom came as much from the fact that no one knew where I was, as from walking the seafront of Naples before noon on a fine December morning. The three hours at my disposal - a space of time that now, when all days are my own, often passes unnoticed - seemed then a gift, a luxury beyond which one need not forecast. I did not doubt that I would turn up again at the Hotel Royal at three. The only thing to be thought of was how to spend these hours of one's own. I possessed a single introduction to Naples - one letter provided by a London acquaintance who had encouraged me to present myself at the address on the envelope. 'Somewhere in the thick of Naples,' said this wellwisher, who had never himself been there. The address was that of a woman whose name had become known - and was by then becoming forgotten - in connection with one of the post-war films from Italy. There was <i>Bicycle Thieves</i>, you remember; there was <i>Shoeshine</i>, there was Open City. And then there was a film called <i>Del Tempo Felice</i> that was made from an obscure little book, a sort of prose poem; and it was the author of this book whose name was on my envelope. I had never read it, her book. I had seen her film, but I was then very young and had remembered its darkly photographed interiors and flickering close - ups for two reasons - because itwas the first time I had been to a film that used sub - titles; and the first time that I saw the lines of Dante from which the title was taken and which appeared, off-centre, on the screen along with the other credits, duly translated in sub-title but carrying, as sometimes happens, in their own, then unfamiliar, language the physical aspect of poetry that sends a shiver across the sight and skin. And now that there was time to call myself to her attention, I could only think: a woman of this kind, with work, friends, admirers - a public, even - would hardly welcome a stranger with no better credentials than a note (a note which I had seen for myself began 'Dear Signorina') from a remote acquaintance at Ealing Studios. The name - her Christian name, that is - had struck me; also the address, for there was a street number, then simply 'San Biagio dei Librai': Saint Biagio of the Booksellers. I had remarked on this address when the letter was handed to me. And the friend at Ealing - who had known the lady, it now came out, only outside Italy - said, 'Let's hope I got it right. I rather gather this is the good old family palazzo. I hope she'll do you proud.' All had, in fact, been in the realm of aspiration or surmise. It occurred to me, as I walked back to the Hotel Vesuvio, that I might telephone this Signorina at once and see if she would have me. But the prospect of picking up the telephone and shattering her unsuspecting morning was more than I could face for her; and when I got up to my room I took out, instead of her address, a guidebook that had lain one month in the bureau drawer. 'The traveller who would know Naples,' - so the guidebook dictated, open on the hotel counterpane - 'must take himself to Spaccan�poli, the split of Naples, the street that traversed the city's nucleus in classical times, and is now called San Biagio dei Librai.' Nevertheless it took some time to make the call. First I got cut off, and in the wire a low voice asked, though not of me, <i>'Tu, come giudichi?'</i> Then I heard the telephone ringing, ringing, and was about to hang up at the instant when the ringing exchanged itself for a voice. Tracing the hotel's stitched monogram with a nervous finger, I made myself known; and in English the voice cried, 'Good. Good that you called. Yes, come, come. Come now. Come for lunch. Are you coming in a taxi? - my street is up, you can't enter, it's the drains. Tell him to let you out at the Ges� Nuovo, the church. Then ask the way, it's only a few minutes on foot from there.' &nbsp; <br> Below the Ges� Nuovo there is a ramp of a street that rises to a corner where Degas once lived with his Neapolitan relatives. The ascent, oblique, suggests the piazza above by giving, as if through a door ajar on a high landing, a glimpse of the exorbitant, gem - cut fa�ade of a church, with to the left a flash of red stucco, to the right an ornate obelisk, before it catapults you on to a scene that appears, from this method of approaching it, more bizarre than ever. Had I been accompanied, I might have laughed out loud at the profligacy of imagination expended there; but solitude, which is held to be a cause of eccentricity, in fact imposes excessive normality, at least in public, and I crossed the piazza with no outward sign of interest and placed myself against the faceted stones of the church. From there one looked, then, across at the bombed shell of Santa Chiara, half-reconstructed, and at a derelict campanile on the one hand and a massive palace on the other; and this I did for some moments, only showing it was new to me by inquiring, of the priest who came to close the church, the way to San Biagio dei Librai. The day had deteriorated, it was winter again, and the piazza was abandoned for the siesta. One pre-war Fiat, as lonely, as historic as the single car on an antiquated postcard, had beenparked in the middle of the square. And I, perhaps, walking away from the church door, would have something now of the same anonymous arrested look - captured, as the saying goes, in the picture; serving to show, merely, by human contrast, the dimensions of buildings, to date the photograph unwittingly with my clothes and hair; somebody purloined from a crowd to act as an example. The light itself had dwindled to the joyless sepia of an old photograph. The picture is re-animated - rather, it dissolves to life - and I enter a passageway of a street, the narrow channel that flows out from the farther side of the square. Past a hundred shops and stalls that sold, as they are selling still, song records, coloured nylon sponges, the gauze and sugar paraphernalia of christenings and first communions, plastic Bambis, bolts of print material, gold jewellery and silver representations of arms and legs to be offered up to departmental saints; past open sacks of coffee beans, stacks of books new and seventh-hand, and barrows piled with handtools - through this I came, that afternoon, into San Biagio dei Librai. What could be closed was closing in a savage drum - roll of descending grilles; what could be wheeled was being trundled away. Over cobbled blocks - that were posted here and there with stone bollards intended to keep out the cars that expertly slid between them and rushed on to straddle a long trench of drainage repairs - I walked by palaces of stone and stucco, rusticated or red, white with grey facings, brown, orange, rose or ochre, no two alike, facing each other across the street's corridor as monumentally as if they had been rising, isolated, in some open place that did their proportions justice. On the flanks of those palaces, smaller buildings had been grafted in every age except our own - in any unlikely opening, or any precarious ledge, apparently with the sole provision that they bear no resemblance to one another. Forgotten or overlaid, antiquity had been buried in the walls, making its laconicsignal - a sunken column, Greek, dark, smooth as silk, with acanthus capital; a Roman inscription, traces of a fortification, or crenellations that, centuries since, had been surmounted by a rooftop. In one vast courtyard was planted a colossal sculpture, Roman or Renaissance, of a horse's head; another ended in galleries of disintegrating frescoes. It was a deep square of a building, hers; pale stucco divided into a dozen apartments, or a hundred. The <i>portiere,</i> coming out from his lunch with his fork, spooled with pasta, in his hand, directed me to the <i>pian' nobile</i>, taking me into the courtyard to point out, in a fold of that flaking parchment, the inner staircase I should take. There were several flights of deep stone steps, u...</p><h2>59 Authentic Turn-of-the-Century Fashion Patterns (Dover Fashion and Costumes)</h2><p>The dressmaker's patterns for the more than 50 different garments included in this volume first appeared in the 1890s in issues of the quarterly <i>The Voice of Fashion</i>. Most of the patterns are for stylish daywear for women, but there are house dresses and nightwear as well, along with a selection of suits and dresses for young boys and girls and several garments for men.<br>Reproduced from rare original issues of <i>The Voice of Fashion</i>, these patterns show that although most ladies' fashions of the 1890s were designed to conceal the body behind high necks, long sleeves, and full, floor-length skirts, a lively interest in revealing the female figure persisted. Elegant hand craftsmanship and the luxuriant draping of rich fabric further enhanced this statuesque idealization of femininity.<br>An informational general introduction to dressmaker's patterns and concise instructions for using them precede this lively parade of <i>fin-de-si�cle</i> fashions. Readers will also find over 575 patterns and illustrations detailing the various garments, with individual instructions for making them. Costume enthusiasts interested in re-creating exact copies of vintage clothing will find this book an indispensable guide; indeed, anyone interested in the history of fashion and costume will welcome this fascinating reference to late Victorian dressmaking.</p><p></p><h2>Collected Poems of Bob Kaufman</h2><p><p>"The <em>Collected Poems of Bob Kaufman</em> is the most comprehensive selection of his verse to date, a volume that contains a lot of previously uncollected work. ... this book makes a case for him as a perceptive and eccentric American original, a man who seems to have fallen out of the sky like a meteor."&#x2014;<strong><em>The New York Times</em></strong></p><p>"The body of work is small but voluminous in intensity, spirit and soul, with a lineage that runs from Charles Baudelaire to Charles Mingus.

He is among the inaugurators of what today is characterized as the Afro-Surreal, uniting the surrealist practice of automatic writing with the jazz concept of spontaneous composition. He seldom wrote his poems down and often discarded those he did, leaving them to be rescued by others. He was also a legendary figure of the Beat Generation, known as much for hopping on tables to declaim his poetry as for maintaining a monastic silence for months or even years at a time.</p><p>Kaufman produced just three broadsides and three books in his lifetime. In 1967, <em>Golden Sardine</em> was published by City Lights in its famed Pocket Poets Series, and became an instant cult classic. <em>Collected Poems</em> is a landmark poetic achievement, bringing together all of Kaufman&#x2019;s known surviving poems, including an extensive section of previously uncollected work, in a long overdue return to City Lights Books.</p><p><strong>Praise for <em>Collected Poems of Bob Kaufman</em>:</strong></p><p>"Bob Kaufman volcanically en-veined the Beats as a mirage enveloped Surrealist; not as a formal poet, but one, like Rimbaud, who embodied butane.

For many he exists as the man who wrote poems on newspaper margins, the man flowing with piled jazz infused visions as wife or friend transcribed his surrealistic rants, the man yelling poems at strangers parking their cars on North Beach street corners, the man repeatedly and repeatedly arrested on San Francisco streets, at times after being harshly beaten by the arresting officers, the man who took a vow of silence unbroken for eleven years. For me he began as the father of a long-forgotten toddler playmate. He was my parents&#x2019; friend who came to house parties and wreaked havoc. He was the author of a yellow-covered little book of poetry that held my father&#x2019;s favorite poem, which he often quoted:</p><br><p>The first man was an idealist, but he died,<br> he couldn&#x2019;t survive the first truth,<br> discovering that the whole<br> world, all of it, was all his . . . (&#x201c;Suicide&#x201d;)</p><br><p>He was the one who spoke, at least to my father and me, during his mythological monkish self-imposed silence. He was for me always most real on the page; he was for me, and remains for me, alive and vibrant as a poet whose truths continue to shine with a brilliance that even drugs, alcohol, and electro-shock torture could not snuff out.</p><br><p>My memories of Bob Kaufman are few and fleeting and always in concert with my father. My father and I were walking towards Broadway. I think we had just left City Lights Bookstore. We were in North Beach to get a gift, birthday I expect, for my mother. As we hit Broadway there was Bob Kaufman leaning against a light pole. My father called out; Bob saw my father and remembered him and the two of them hugged and laughed. It had been years since they had last talked, but the ropes that bound them as Afro-diasporic brothers of fate, as comrades of North Beach 1950s streets, and as part of the small cloister of Black male artists and writers who haunted those alleys and bars, were as strong as ever. Bob asked after my mother, my brother, and then me. My father told him repeatedly that I was standing right there, that I was grown now. Bob chuckled when he finally understood and invited us to his small hotel room.</p><br><p>We walked a couple of blocks to the room, which was dark and sparse, and sharing the bed while I perched on the one chair, the two of them talked in that shorthand way that only friends understand, a sigh here, a quiet laugh there, and an unspent tear on the other side. I was witness only. My father told Bob that I wrote poetry and was pretty good. Bob, as I remember, took no notice. We left and it seemed there was a certain sadness in my father&#x2019;s goodbye.</p><br><p>A couple of years later I was given a featured reading spot at the long-demolished Coffee Gallery where Bob had often held court. My father, a pipe smoker at that point, had gone outside to fill a bowl and inhale a few lungfuls of aromatic smoke. As he stood in the doorway, Bob walked up. My father asked Bob to come in and hear me read. Bob sipped on the beer my father had bought him and sat through a few of the opening readers until I was called to the stage. I signed the back wall with much humility upon seeing up close all the names of former featured readers etched large and small, printed and cursive, on this monument to North Beach poetics. Then I read my poetry, sincere but raw, infused with the passion of the &#x2019;70s, with a Black Arts spin and a young romantic love compulsion. Bob drank beer with my parents and waited until I sat back down. He gave me his approval, &#x201c;Good stuff&#x201d; or some such phrase, and left the place. I was absolutely buzzing with excitement. Just his presence, his quiet support, was my ticket to continue to ride the wild and sometimes tortuous seas of poetry.</p><br><p>That was the last time I remember seeing Bob in the flesh. But his words, his poems, had been my companion through my lonely and mis-fitting teens. I had carried <em>Golden Sardine</em> and <em>Solitudes Crowded with Loneliness</em> from San Francisco to Hong Kong, and then on to Kathmandu, Nepal, Kabul, Afghanistan, and Istanbul, Turkey, only to arrive in Paris, where I spent a couple of weeks working and sleeping at George Whitman&#x2019;s bookstore, Shakespeare and Co. One day, after finishing my couple of hours of chores to pay for my bed for the night, I came downstairs to see a young Parisian reading Bob&#x2019;s <em>Solitudes Crowded with Loneliness</em>. I was amazed. &#x201c;You like Kaufman?&#x201d; I asked in my limited French, rich with vocabulary and impoverished with grammar. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; he answered in English, &#x201c;he is the best.&#x201d; He said something about Rimbaud and Baudelaire, and I said, yes, I knew some of their poetry, too. I asked him if he had read <em>Golden Sardine</em>. &#x201c;He has another book?&#x201d; the young man asked in surprise. &#x201c;Yes, I have a copy upstairs.&#x201d; He appealed to me to let him read it. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t lose it,&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;It has carried me over half the world.&#x201d; He promised me that he would not move from that spot. I brought him the book and he sat for the next couple of hours reading it and then returned it to me with effusive thanks. I was intrigued. In Paris Bob Kaufman was literary hero while in America he was mostly unknown, and when remembered, it was mostly mythology and lies. <em>The Collected Poems of Bob Kaufman</em> presents the real Bob Kaufman, a man who lived and spoke through his poems.</p><br><p>In April of 1925, as the seventh of thirteen children, Bob Kaufman was born of mixed ancestry, in New Orleans, Louisiana with an Afro-Caribbean mother from Louisiana and a Jewish father of German and French ancestry, at a time when interracial marriage was illegal. Maybe it was that heritage&#x2014;hewn in a city that was so racially conflicted and culturally rich, that heritage nurtured in a city where his Martinican grandmother&#x2019;s Vodun, the Catholicism of his mother, and the Judaism of his father&#x2014;which taught him that the world was a complex place where love and spirit, and faith and reality, held central and often conflicting roles. Bob Kaufman was steeped in diverse traditions before he boarded a Merchant Marine ship as a teenager and spent six years sailing the world, and, in stories he told, survived four shipwrecks while circumnavigating the globe several times, tasting exotic foods, reading a breadth of literature, seeing wide swaths of art, and learning a global history from the underside up.</p><br><p>What is most exciting about this volume of poetry is that it shows that Kaufman cannot be fit into one box. He certainly is a Beat poet, although you will rarely find his name or his seminal role listed in articles and books about the Beats. But then he was not &#x201c;beat&#x201d; in the meaning attributed to Jack Kerouac, beat down and beat back, rather he was of the beat and through the beat like the jazz poetry that he performed. He was a Beat poet who in his poem Oct. 5th, 1963&#x2014;which takes the form of a letter to the editors of the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>&#x2014;noted that:</p><br><p>"It is not the beat played by who is beating the drum. His is a noisy loud one, the silent beat is beaten by who is not beating on the drum, his silent beat drowns out all the noise, it comes before and after every beat, you hear it in beatween, its sound is Bob Kaufman, Poet"</p><br><p>He can rightfully be considered a surrealist poet, as the French like to say, the &#x201c;Black Rimbaud.&#x201d; After all he did &#x201c;acknowledge the demands of Surrealist realization&#x201d; (&#x201c;Sullen Bakeries of Total Recall&#x201d;) and then again what other kind of poet would write, as in &#x201c;Bagel Shop Jazz&#x201d;:</p><br><p>Shadow people, projected on coffee-shop walls.<br>Memory formed echoes of a generation past<br> Beating into now.</p><br><p>Nightfall creatures, eating each other<br>Over a noisy cup of coffee.</p><br><p>Mulberry-eyed girls in black stockings,<br>Smelling vaguely of mint jelly and last night&#x2019;s bongo drummer...</p><br><p>But I think what Kaufman wrote, what Kaufman orated, what he be-bopped out of his brain and soul, was not more than real to him, but simply real. It was what he saw and how he saw it. When he asks &#x201c;Would You Wear My Eyes,&#x201d; he doesn&#x2019;t just call the question, he dares the reader. Are you willing to see a &#x201c;face . . . covered with maps of dead nations&#x201d; (&#x201c;Would You Wear My Eyes?&#x201d;)? Do you want to discover, like he did in his &#x201c;Jail Poems,&#x201d; that:</p><br><p>All night the stink of rotting people,<br>Fumes rising from pyres of live men,<br>Fill my nose with gassy disgust,<br>Drown my exposed eyes in tears.</p><br><p>He offers both critiques and applause to artists in a broad range of fields&#x2014;Dylan Thomas, Baudelaire, Billie Holliday, Bartok, Picasso, Mondrian, Hart Crane, Lorca, Camus, and others&#x2014;letting us see and know the many wells from which he drank.</p><br><p>For Kaufman there are no lines between poetry that spews from the evening news&#x2014;the bottomless valley of forgetting from whence he lifts Caryl Chessman, and sings dirges to the children of Hiroshima, and questions Camus in hard, biting questions about the writer&#x2019;s colonial position on Algeria&#x2014;or poetry that echoes with choruses of music&#x2014;mostly, but not only, jazz and blues&#x2014;or poetry that grows from a tree of spirituality rooted in Buddhism but aware of the breadth of Christianity and the depths of traditional African religion.</p><br><p>I remember my father telling me a story about Bob calling him and telling him that he needed to come to North Beach the next day and help build a Buddhist Temple. My father tried to tell Bob he had other obligations, but Bob pressed him, and in the end my father found himself with a team Bob had organized helping to build a Buddhist Temple in San Francisco. Maybe that effort and his years of silence is why Buddhism is the cloak most people wrap Kaufman in. No doubt he had a Buddhist practice, but there has always been a unity reflecting a breadth of crossroads to and through faith in his poetical vision. And when he speaks directly to God, not only his humor but also an idea of spirituality that is inclusive of more than Buddhism, is intact:</p><br><p>it&#x2019;s all right fellows, it&#x2019;s just a joke,<br>you had me scared for a moment God, i thought you were serious,<br>i was beginning to believe that this was really your idea of life,<br>i know second fifth, but you made it sound so unbelievable,<br>You&#x2019;re the only one in this whole big universal gin mill, believe me god,<br>who could get away with it, even that oldest boy of yours<br>&amp; yet even he, your own<br>fleshlessness &amp; bloodlessness, was helpless when it came to dirty<br> jokes. (&#x201c;I Wish...&#x201d;)</p><br><p>Or in his &#x201c;Heavy Water Blues&#x201d; when he notes:</p><br><p>When reading all those thick books on the life of god,<br>it should be noted that they were all written by men.</p><br><p>It is perfectly all right to cast the first stone,<br>if you have some more in your pocket.</p><br><p>From <em>Golden Sardine</em> and <em>Solitudes</em> through the &#x201c;Abomunist Manifesto&#x201d; and its later addendum through the <em>Ancient Rain</em>, from gems of previously uncollected poems through <em>Beatitudes</em> (a magazine that Kaufman confounded and edited with Allen Ginsberg, John Kelly, and William Margolis), this volume lets Kaufman reveal his life and legacy, his strengths and weaknesses, even as he surveys America, the planet, and indeed the universe with humor, satire, passion, and a lucidity born of jazz riffs and African rhythms. When all is said and done, Kaufman is a poet of the world; mythologies and histories hold court in his poems.</p><br><p>Bob Kaufman will always be surrounded by myth and mystery. He was in San Francisco first in 1946 as a maritime sailor and returned some years later. But was it with his brother Donald in 1950, as some have said, or with Burroughs and Ginsberg whom he met in New York, as others aver? Thus, if one wants to know Bob Kaufman, it is best to look not in the filigree memories and scraps of official papers that can be offered, but in his poems. His life is laid out there.</p><br><p>Whether I am a poet or not, I use fifty dollars&#x2019; worth of air every day, cool.<br>In order to exist I hide behind stacks of red and blue poems<br></p><p>(&#x201c;Afterwards, They Shall Dance&#x201d;)</p><br><p>It is in his poems you find his love for his son Parker, his second wife Eileen, and several other friends and family members who shared his road if only for a season. In his poems you find Kaufman</p><br><p>Seeing only the holdings<br>Inside the walls of me,<br>Feeling the roots that bind me,<br>To this mere human tree<br>(&#x201c;Private Sadness&#x201d;)</p><br><p>Kaufman is also unabashedly Black or, in the fading lingo of his times, Negro. He proclaims who he is but seems to also magnify to become more than just his person, as in &#x201c;Oregon&#x201d; where he chants:</p><br><p>You are with me Oregon,<br>Day and night, I feel you, Oregon.<br>I am Negro, I am Oregon.<br> Oregon is me, the planet</p><br><p>Kaufman is indeed a Black Beat and wants this to be remembered, wants his sense of self to be remembered. I don&#x2019;t doubt Kaufman heard people repeatedly say, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see color,&#x201d; which loosely translated means, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see you.&#x201d; Bob Kaufman demands to be not just heard but seen and to have his people seen, as in &#x201c;Untitled&#x201d;:</p><br><p>THE SUN IS A NEGRO.<br></p><p>THE MOTHER OF THE SUN IS A NEGRO.</p><br><p>One wonders if Kaufman was always a poet. True, he told some that he studied briefly at New York&#x2019;s the New School in the 1940s where he met William Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg, with whom he travelled to San Francisco, but this was likely part of the mythology he created. (Ginsberg, for example, said they met in 1959.) Is it more likely that he became a poet much earlier, while he walked the streets of New Orleans, while he sailed the planet&#x2019;s numbered seas? Although he was dead at the relatively young age of 60 after living nearly half of his life in San Francisco, he left an impressive body of work, albeit small in the number of pages, and most of it can be found in this volume. Here one finds the familiar and the more recently unearthed and translated, the deeply personal and the adamantly political, the profoundly spiritual and wryly philosophical, all braided with cosmic and comic realities of our universe. This book is a reflection of Kaufman&#x2019;s genius, a welcome gathering of his songs and chants, a needed compendium of the depth of his heart and the breadth of his knowledge and the humility of his spirit.</p><br><p>When Kaufman speaks in &#x201c;Dolorous Echo&#x201d; of holes in skin and hairs on head that won&#x2019;t stay dead ending with &#x201c;When I die, / I won&#x2019;t stay / Dead,&#x201d; he speaks a truth that we can be grateful for. Alive and in full verse, his poems can be found here revealing his life, his soul, his prayers, and his reflections on our planet and universe in language that reads as vibrantly today as they were when he spat them out, filling the ears of all who would listen.</p><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can, of course, simply read this book, poem to poem, and become immersed in the rhythms, the emotions, the insights, the songs. But I recommend you put some music in back as you read. Play some Charlie Parker and Thelonious Monk, go find that Billie Holiday, discover or rediscover that Coltrane, find not only some Ray Charles but some gut-bucket blues, and slip in a bit of Bartok to better...</p></p><h2>Mini Knitted Woodland</h2><p>Knitters of all skill levels will love to make this charming, fun mini woodland scene.

Her work has appeared in knitting and parenting magazines. She lives and works freelance in West Sussex, England.Mini Knitted Woodland, which was released in March. This book has adorable animals from porcupines, owls, bears and more. The first animal I made was the porcupine/hedgehog. Unfortunately someone took it to play with before I got a picture and now we cannot find it. It was extremely easy and quick to make. Next I made the beaver. Again my sewing up process was not great, but Hazel still loves him. This book includes many woodland animals, mushrooms, trees, tree stumps, and a gnome as well as a forest floor mat. I am thinking I will knit up some more animals and use them for her Wild Kratts party. Maybe I can find a pattern to knit a little Chris and Martin Kratt too.

There are twenty seven charming wee creatures to make plus a mat to display them on, or play with them of course. Have fun recycling all that leftover yarn and improver knitters will welcome all the small projects as none are too advanced, just using knit and purl. You can&#39;t learn to knit with this book (Search Press publishes many excellent books that do start from scratch) but the mat is described as a good way to practice the basics. The creatures themselves use mostly tiny amounts of yarn (less than 5g) and are made flat, with instructions on how to sew up. All you need to start are a few basic bits and pieces - no major spending involved. Choose from mostly UK or US animals and birds, filling your wood with badger, beaver, blue tit, robin and otter or maybe a bear, skunk, moose, wolf and racoon. Also included are a gnome, toadstool house, mushroom, tree and tree stump as well as animal young of several species. Each pattern is in written form with photos of the finished creature, finished size, what you need and a difficulty level. The author mentions that it doesn&#39;t have to be made as a whole set, but odd creatures can be made up to serve as bag charms, keyrings or for charity. This is another attractive and user-friendly book that is sure to give knitters of all abilities a lot of fun, as well as anybody who gets to play with the figures. * Myshelf.com * February 2015 The miniature knitting series by Sachiyo Ishii is a real favourite in the LK office.

Behind a dusty Georgia carny show. . . In a mausoleum in Baton Rouge, or in an alley in Calcutta. . . Here wanderers come to rest, the lost and lonely press their bodies up against each other, the heat rises, flesh yields, bones are bared, blood spills. This is the landscape of today&#x2019;s most brilliant young horror writer, Poppy Z. Brite. <br><br>Now, in a collection that sings like cutting edge rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll and shows the deft touch of a master storyteller, Poppy Z.

Brite is well known to most horror fans. What some do not know, though, is that Brite hit the ground running as a fiction writer, and some of her best work so far is right here in this collection of a dozen tales (originally published as <i>Swamp Foetus</i>) she wrote between ages 18 and 24. The exigencies of long plot development and evolving characters that sometimes bog her down in the novels are absent from the short story form, where Brite's extraordinary talent for compressed, redolent imagery combines with her keen sense of narrative structure to create perfect little <i>objets d'art.</i> Stories like "His Mouth Will Taste of Wormwood," "Calcutta, Lord of Nerves," and my favorite, "The Sixth Sentinel," are too exquisite to be missed.<b>Poppy Z. Brite</b>&#x2019;s first novel,&nbsp;<i>Lost Souls</i>, was nominated for Best First Novel of 1992 by the Horror Writers Association and for a Lambda Literary Award. Her second book,&nbsp;<i>Drawing Blood</i>, was also nominated for a Lambda Literary Award and the Bram Stoker Award. Her short stories have appeared in numerous anthologies. She lives and writes in New Orleans.</p><h2>Illusion Town (A Harmony Novel)</h2><p><b>A new adventure begins on Harmony...&nbsp; </b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>With its opulent casinos and hotels, the desert city of Illusion Town is totally unique&#x2014;and will take you on a thrill ride you&#x2019;ll never forget.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Hannah West isn&#x2019;t the first woman to wake up in Illusion Town married to a man she barely knows, but she has no memory of the ceremony at all.

Maass examines how an ordinary Serb could wake up one morning and shoot his neighbor, once a friend--then rape that neighbor's wife. He conveys the desperation that makes a Muslim beg the United States to bomb his own city in order to end the misery. And Maass does not falter at the spectacle of U.N. soldiers shining searchlights on fleeing refugees--who are promptly gunned down by snipers waiting in the darkness. <b>Love Thy Neighbor</b> gives us an unflinching vision of a late-20th-century hell that is also a scathing inquiry into the worst extremes of human nature. Like Michael Herr's <b>Dispatches</b> (also available in Vintage paperback), it is an utterly gripping book that will move and instruct readers for years to come.</p><p>Peter Maass from the center of the nightmare in Bosnia, a war correspondent&#39;s montage of images - eerie, grotesque, ironic, angry, absurd. A Serb and Muslim, friends before the war, exchanging gossip via shortwave radio hours before they will try to kill each other. The Serbian president coolly denying reports of atrocities that have been witnessed by hundreds. A battlefield doctor performing miracles of surgery without anesthetic. Drivers without headlights gambling their lives in the darkness of no-man&#39;s-land while schoolchildren scamper across Sniper Alley. The author takes us with him into the minefields of modern war with a fierce, vivid, and personal book.<b>Peter Maass</b>&nbsp;is a contributing writer to&nbsp;<i>The New York Times Magazine</i>&nbsp;and has reported from the Middle East, Asia, South America and Africa. He has written as well for&nbsp;<i>The New Yorker</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>,<i>&nbsp;The Washington Post,&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Slate</i>.

Jeff Wolf Green&#39;s writing embodies everything you would expect from Pluto; intense, powerful,riveting, transformative and penetrating .A book that satiates both the desire for knowledge and the deep yearning for true understanding is a rare find indeed, and just as profound as the information included here, is thedeep intuitive awakening it will bring to your own soul. If you want to help yourself and assist other in conscious evolution, rather than simply waiting for it to happen, this book is the essential map for that journey!</p><p>Jeffrey Wolf Green has been called the founder of Evolutionary Astrology, and rightly so. He began to lecture on Evolutionary Astrology in 1977, and wrote this first book called Pluto: The Evolutionary Journey Of The Soul in 1985. He has lectured all around the world, and this book has been translated in eight languages. The Evolutionary Astrology that he taught is a pioneering work that allows for a complete understanding of the Souls evolutionary journey from life to life. He established schools in Chile, Israel, England, Holland, Canada, America, and Germany. He also created a video correspondence course in 1994, and wrote the second volume to this work in 1996 called Pluto: The Soul&#39;s Evolutionary Journey Through Relationships. His daughter, Deva Green, also edited a book of his unpublished lectures called The Evolutionary Journey Of The Soul: Essays in Evolutionary Astrology in 2011.For the student of astrology, Jeffrey Wolf Green outlines his specific methodology for natal chart interpretation that links Pluto to the moon&#39;s planetary nodes. This original and brilliant synthesis provides an easily accessible, yet profound way to understand how our past life selves affect our present day consciousness, as well as how to evolve beyond these past limiting patterns. This book includes not only a unique methodology that laid the cornerstone for Evolutionary Astrology, but also a comprehensive cosmology that will completely alter how you view your destiny. This is not a book to read, it is a book to osmose - slowly, deliberately, and consciously.

With devastating clarity, Gilligan traces the role that shame plays in the etiology of murder and explains why our present penal system only exacerbates it. Brilliantly argued, harrowing in its portraits of the walking dead, <i>Violence </i>should be read by anyone concerned with this national epidemic and its widespread consequences.<br>"Extraordinary.

So I want to invite you on a pilgrimage. Rwanda is often held up as a model of evangelization in Africa. Yet in 1994, beginning on the Thursday of Easter week, Christians killed other Christians, often in the same churches where they had worshiped together. The most Christianized country in Africa became the site of its worst genocide. With a mother who was a Hutu and a father who was a Tutsi, author Emmanuel Katongole is uniquely qualified to point out that the tragedy in Rwanda is also a mirror reflecting the deep brokenness of the church in the West. Rwanda brings us to a cry of lament on our knees where together we learn that we must interrupt these patterns of brokenness But Rwanda also brings us to a place of hope. Indeed, the only hope for our world after Rwanda&#x2019;s genocide is a new kind of Christian identity for the global body of Christ&#x2015;a people on pilgrimage together, a mixed group, bearing witness to a new identity made possible by the Gospel.</p><p>Emmanuel M. Katongole is associate research professor of theology and world Christianity in the Divinity School at Duke University and the co-director of the Duke Center for Reconciliation. He is a Catholic priest of the Kampala Archdiocese, Uganda.<br><br>Jonathan Wilson-Hartgrove is an associate minister at St. Johns Baptist Church. A graduate of Duke Divinity School, Jonathan is engaged in reconciliation efforts in Durham, North Carolina, directs the School for Conversion (newmonasticism.org), and is a sought-after speaker and author of several books. The Rutba House, where Jonathan lives with his wife, Leah, their son, JaiMichael, daughter, Nora Ann, and other friends, is a new monastic community that prays, eats, and lives together, welcoming neighbors and homeless.

The mistake takes the shape of Anne Shirley, a redheaded 11-year-old girl who can talk anyone under the table. Fortunately, her sunny nature and quirky imagination quickly win over her reluctant foster parents. Anne's feisty spirit soon draws many friends--and much trouble--her way. Not a day goes by without some melodramatic new episode in the tragicomedy of her life. Early on, Anne declares her eternal antipathy for Gilbert Blythe, a classmate who commits the ultimate sin of mocking her hair color. Later, she accidentally dyes that same cursed hair green. Another time, in her haste to impress a new neighbor, she bakes a cake with liniment instead of vanilla. Lucy Maud Montgomery's series of books about Anne have remained classics since the early 20th century. Her portrayal of this feminine yet independent spirit has given generations of girls a strong female role model, while offering a taste of another, milder time in history.

Featuring both Eastern and Western methods, it presents step-by-step, beautifully illustrated instructions on everything from traditional massage to shiatsu and reflexology.<i> The Book of Massage</i> offers easy-to-follow techniques for giving the perfect massage, including advice on creating the right setting and suggestions for using aromatic oils and lotions. Now revised and updated with fresh color photos and drawings throughout, <i>The Book of Massage</i> is a simple and comprehensive handbook that reveals how you can experience the myriad benefits of giving and receiving a soothing massage.</p><p>With more than 650,000 copies sold, massage therapist Lucinda Lidell's <i>Book of Massage</i> has been updated with new photos and instructional drawings. Not for the prudish, as the subjects in most of the photos are completely in the buff, the book presents an intense, information-packed, step-by-step guide to traditional massage, shiatsu, and reflexology.<p> No matter which method you choose to focus on (you're advised to choose one at a time), Lidell is thorough in her explanations of the strokes and techniques necessary to give relaxing, therapeutic massage in the privacy of your own home. Detailed drawings, diagrams, and photographs help to further demonstrate how to address each individual body part.</p><p> Divided into distinct chapters for each of the three methods, <i>The Book of Massage</i> also includes several sections that Lidell stresses are fundamental to all types of massage. The first is "Beginning," with information such as creating the right atmosphere (a warm room and soft lighting), applying oil, and finding a comfortable position. Additionally, Lidell suggests that everyone should review sections on the human touch and anatomy, both of which oddly come at the end of the book.</p><p> As thorough as <i>The Book of Massage</i> may be, do not expect to walk away from it an expert.

It was a time when injustice was met by a lust for vengeance, and rarely was a distinction made between the innocent and the guilty. Against this tumultuous historical backdrop, Dickens' great story of unsurpassed adventure and courage unfolds. Unjustly imprisoned for 18 years in the Bastille, Dr. Alexandre Manette is reunited with his daughter, Lucie, and safely transported from France to England. It would seem that they could take up the threads of their lives in peace. As fate would have it though, the pair are summoned to the Old Bailey to testify against a young Frenchman &#x2014; Charles Darnay &#x2014; falsely accused of treason. Strangely enough, Darnay bears an uncanny resemblance to another man in the courtroom, the dissolute lawyer's clerk Sydney Carton. It is a coincidence that saves Darnay from certain doom more than once. Brilliantly plotted, the novel is rich in drama, romance, and heroics that culminate in a daring prison escape in the shadow of the guillotine. &#x201c;It was the best of times, it was the worst of times&#x201d;, those days in which your English Literature professor ordered you to read &#x201c;A Tale of Two Cities&#x201d; by Charles Dickens. You were immediately confounded by the perplexity of the story and confused by the language of the times. In your despair, you struggled, endeavored and persevered to reach the conclusion of the classic novel. Having satisfactorily completed the requirements of that difficult semester, you vowed to never again read classic English literature. As the years accumulated, you garnered wisdom and spirituality as you aged and you gathered far greater literary acumen. Your mind was transformed and you began to yearn for the great stories that could only be told by the true masters. Anon, you found yourself immersed in the incredible classic writings of Charles Dickens. For no one could so completely transport you to the mean filthy streets of Oliver Twist&#x2019;s London or the horror and dread of The Reign of Terror in that unfortunate tale of London and Paris in the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-three. No other writer could place you so deeply into the mind of a tyrannical boss such as Ebenezer Scrooge or imbue the viciousness of a violent revolutionary the likes of Madame Defarge. Contemporary writers only wish they had the amazing ability to create magnificent unlikely heroes and fantastic characters whose flame of eternal hope burned against an all consuming darkness.</p><p>The classic, definitive, world-famous Nonesuch Press edition of 1937, finally available again and bound in leather and linen. The text in these stunning volumes is taken from the 1867 Chapman and Hall edition, which became known as the Charles Dickens edition and was the last edition to be corrected by the author himself. The Nonesuch edition contains full-color illustrations selected by Dickens himself, by artists including Hablot Knight Browne ("Phiz"), George Cruikshank, John Leech, Robert Seymour, and George Cattermole.<br><br> <i>The Nonesuch Dickens</i> reproduces the original elegance of these beautiful editions. Books are printed on natural cream-shade high quality stock, quarter bound in bonded leather with cloth sides, include a ribbon marker, and feature special printed endpapers. Each volume is wrapped in a protective, clear acetate jacket.<br><br> The books are available as individual volumes, or as sets. The six-volume set contains <i>Oliver Twist, Bleak House, Christmas Books, Nicholas Nickleby, David Copperfield,</i> and <i>Great Expectations</i> together with <i>Hard Times</i>. The three-volume set contains <i>A Tale of Two Cities, Little Dorrit,</i> and <i>The Life and Adventures of Martin Chuzzlewit</i>.With his sublime parting words, &#34;It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done...&#34; Sidney Carton joins that exhalted group of Dickensian characters who have earned a permanent place in the popular literary imagination. His dramatic story, set against the volcanic fury of the French Revolution and pervaded by the ominous rumble of the death carts trundling toward the guillotine, is the heart-stirring tale of a heroic soul in an age gone mad. A masterful pageant of idealism, love, and adventure -- in a Paris bursting with revolutionary frenzy, and a London alive with anxious anticipation -- &#34;A Tale of Two Cities is one of Dickens&#39;s most energetic and exciting works.</p><h2>Resorting to Murder: A Collection of Holiday Mysteries (British Library Crime Classics)</h2><p><p><strong>Mystery crime fiction written in the Golden Age of Murder</strong></p><p>"This volume in Poisoned Pen's British Library Crime Classics series is ideal summer vacation reading." &#x2015;<em>Publishers Weekly</em></p><p>Holidays offer us the luxury of getting away from it all. So, in a different way, do detective stories. This collection of vintage mysteries combines both those pleasures. From a golf course at the English seaside to a pension in Paris, and from a Swiss mountain resort to the cliffs of Normandy, this new selection shows the enjoyable and unexpected ways in which crime writers have used summer holidays as a theme.</p><p>These fourteen stories range widely across the golden age of British crime fiction. Stellar names from the past are well represented&#x2015;Arthur Conan Doyle and G. K. Chesterton, for instance&#x2015;with classic stories that have won acclaim over the decades. The collection also uncovers a wide range of hidden gems: Anthony Berkeley&#x2015;whose brilliance with plot had even Agatha Christie in raptures&#x2015;is represented by a story so (undeservedly) obscure that even the British Library does not own a copy. The stories by Phyllis Bentley and Helen Simpson are almost equally rare, despite the success which both writers achieved, while those by H. C. Bailey, Leo Bruce and the little-known Gerald Findler have seldom been reprinted.</p><p>Each story is introduced by the editor, Martin Edwards, who sheds light on the authors' lives and the background to their writing.</p></p><p><p><strong>MARTIN EDWARDS</strong> is an award-winning crime writer best known for two series of novels set in Liverpool and the Lake District. He is a series consultant for British Library Crime Classics, Chair of the Crime Writers' Association, and President of the Detection Club. <em>The Golden Age of Murder</em>, his study of the Detection Club, was published in 2015 to international acclaim, and won the Edgar, Agatha, H.R.F. Keating and Macavity awards for the year's best book about the genre.</p><p>It is rare to find a Golden Age anthology in which the majority of the short stories have not been published, multiple times, in other sources. I was delighted to find that this collection was completely fresh, to me, and full of lovely surprises; the humor of Helen Simpson's "A Posteriori" was an especial treat. Highly recommended for all lovers of British mysteries, particularly if planning a holiday!</p> (<i><b>NetGalley</b></i>)<br><br><p>What a fun book! Fourteen stories focused on the Golden Age of British crime writing, the series includes works by both recognized authors such as Agatha Christie, Arthur Conan Doyle and G. K. Chesterton. Many of the stories are quite rare, seldom reprinted, including those by Phyllis Bentley and Helen Simpson. Holidays seem to call for new mystery books, whether it's a trip to the beach in the summer or a trip to grandparents for Christmas. Holiday&nbsp;mysteries were a great love of Christie and an excellent way to get away whether by train, boat, or a comfortable chair by the fire....The settings for these stories reveal the unexpected ways in which crime writers use holidays as a theme. Markedly different from each other, the stories range from a golf course in the English seaside, a pension (budget friendly accommodation) in Paris, and a Swiss mountain resort, to the cliffs of Normandy....This special book follows on the footsteps of two others in the Crime Classics series published by Poisoned Pen Press: <i>Murder in Piccadilly</i> by Charles Kingston and <i>The Sussex Downs Murder</i> by John Bude. Eleven additional titles are set for release in late 2015. And if that isn't exciting enough, beginning in 2016, one title is slated to be released each month!</p> (<i><b><i>The Book Breeze</i></b></i>)<br><br><p>Fourteen reprints from England's golden age of detection (here, 1910-1953) show that although favorite sleuths may go on vacation, murder never does. The very first story, Arthur Conan Doyle's "The Adventure of the Devil's Foot," sets the pattern: rarely reprinted lesser tales that have been neglected for good reason. After Sherlock Holmes untangles "the Cornish horror," Doyle's brother-in-law E.W. Hornung sends Dr. John Dollar to Switzerland to determine why a doctor prescribed his patient a lethal dose of strychnine in "A Schoolmaster Abroad"; Paul Beck, closer to home, confronts the killer of a man unlucky in love in M. McDonnell Bodkin's "The Murder on the Golf Links"; G.K. Chesterton sends poet Gabriel Gale to southern France to reveal the fate of a heterodox fossil scientist in "The Finger of Stone"; H.C. Bailey's Reggie Fortune is on hand to unravel a double attack in the Swiss Alps in "The Hazel Ice"; Dr. John Thorndyke minutely reconstructs the appearance of a seaside victim and his killer in R. Austin Freeman's "A Mystery of the Sand-Hills"; Anthony Berkeley shows Roger Sheringham performing remarkably similar offices on Penhampton Beach in "Razor Edge"; and Sgt. Beef divines how the new governor of a Normandy prison was killed in his car without ever getting clocked out of his office in Leo Bruce's "Holiday Task." Less formulaic but equally routine are Arnold Bennett's "Murder!," set on the Channel Coast, and a pair of stories - Basil Thomson's "The Vanishing of Mrs. Fraser" and Michael Gilbert's businesslike "Cousin Once Removed" - that rehash well-worn patterns. The most original entries here are Gerald Findler's haunted-house tale "The House of Screams"; Phyllis Bentley's spooky, twisty "Where is Mr. Manetot?"; and, best of all, "A Posteriori," Helen Simpson's unexpectedly funny crossing of prim Miss Charters with a spy whose work leaves unforgettable traces. One truth emerges unchallenged: when English detectives go on holiday, they really do seem to relax a bit, or at least their creators do.</p> (<i><b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b></i>)<br><br><p>For anyone who is a fan of stories set in the era of top hats and long dresses would love it. Short stories that are ideal reading for a summer's day. It is of course not very difficult to figure out the endings but it is the language and the nuances of these gems that bring a smile to your face.</p> (<i><b>NetGalley</b></i>)</p><h2>Prentice Hall Science Explorer: Sound And Light</h2><p>Prentice Hall Science Explorer 2007 Sound and Light Student Edition Lead author Michael Padilla once again sets the standard for engaging, hands-on science exploration.

When brought face-to-face with one of Ippei's many marital indiscretions, K&#x14d;ji finds his growing desire for Y&#x16b;ko<br>compels him to action in a way that changes all three of their lives profoundly. Originally published in 1961 and now available in English for the first time, <i>The Frolic of the Beasts</i> is a haunting examination of the various guises we assume throughout our lives, and a tale of psychological self-entrapment, seduction, and murder.</p><p>Yukio Mishima was born in Tokyo in 1925. He graduated from Tokyo Imperial University's School of Jurisprudence in 1947. His first published book, <i>The Forest in Full Bloom</i>, appeared in 1944 and he established himself as a major author with <i>Confessions of a Mask</i> (1949). From then until his death he continued to publish novels, short stories, and plays each year. His crowning achievement, the Sea of Fertility tetralogy&#x2014;which contains the novels <i>Spring Snow</i> (1969), <i>Runaway Horses</i> (1969), <i>The Temple of Daw</i>n (1970), and <i>The Decay of the Angel</i> (1971)&#x2014;is considered one of the definitive works of twentieth-century Japanese fiction. In 1970, at the age of forty-five and the day after completing the last novel in the Fertility series, Mishima committed seppuku (ritual suicide)&#x2014;a spectacular death that attracted worldwide attention.Chapter 1<br><br>K&#x14d;ji thought about the sunlight that shone brightly into the connecting corridor that led to the bathhouse, cascading over the windowsill, spreading out like a sheet of white glossy paper. He didn&#x2019;t know why, but he had humbly, passionately loved the light streaming down through that window. It was divine favor, truly pure&#x2014;dismembered, like the white body of a slain infant. Leaning against the handrail on the upper deck, he marveled at how the abundant early-summer morning sun that his body now comfortably soaked up was at this very instant, in some remote place, joining with the small, exalted, and fragmented sunlight of his memories. It was difficult to believe that this sunlight and the other were of the same substance.<br><br>If he were to trace the diffuse light in front of him, as though reaching hand over hand for a great, sparkling banner, would he eventually touch the tip of a hard, pure tassel of sunlight? And if so, was that pure tassel tip the far, far end of the sunlight? Or was it the distant origin itself of the abundant sunlight right in front of him?<br><br>K&#x14d;ji was traveling aboard the Ry&#x16b;g&#x16b; Maru 20, which had departed from Numazu bound for West Izu. The back-�to-�back benches on the upper deck were sparsely occupied, and the canvas awning sang in the breeze. On the shore, fantastically shaped rocks soared precipitously like a black castle, and high above in the sky, bright cumulus clouds drifted about in disarray. K&#x14d;ji&#x2019;s hair was not yet long enough to be disturbed by the persistent wind.<br><br>He had regular and firm features, and his somewhat old-�fashioned warrior&#x2019;s face and relatively bony nose made him appear like someone whose emotions were easily controlled. But his face was capable of hiding things. My face is like a well-�crafted, carved wooden mask, he thought when he was in good humor.<br><br>There wasn&#x2019;t much pleasure in smoking a cigarette while bearing the brunt of the wind, for it soon deprives the mouth of both the taste and the fragrance of the smoke. But K&#x14d;ji didn&#x2019;t remove the cigarette, continuing to draw deeply on the butt until a strange and bitter sensation filled the back of his head. He had no idea how many he&#x2019;d smoked since leaving Numazu at nine thirty that morning. He couldn&#x2019;t stand the dazzling pitch and roll of the sea. To his unaccustomed eyes, the vast view of the world around him was nothing more than a vague, widely shining, and remote series of linked objects. He turned his thoughts back once more to the sunlight.<br><br>There was nothing more tragic than seeing the miraculous sunlight divided into four by the black window frame. Although K&#x14d;ji loved the sunlight, having joined the crowd by its side, he had always just quickly passed it by. Ahead was the bathhouse, in front of the entrance to which he and his fellow prisoners had first formed a queue and waited their turn. From inside, a cheerless buzzer sounded at three-�minute intervals, accompanied by the vigorous sound of water. Despite the powerful reverberation, the sound of the turbid, heavy water vividly brought to mind a rank liquid the color of dead leaves.<br><br>The numbers one to twelve were written on the floor in green paint, in double horizontal columns close to the entrance to the spacious changing room. Twenty-�four men lined up by these numbers to wait their turn. Three-�minute-�interval buzzer&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The slosh of water. A moment of quiet, then the sound of smacking flesh as somebody slips and tumbles on the wet floor, followed by a burst of laughter, which quickly subsides. Three-�minute-�interval buzzer&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The men who had been waiting undress together and, having deposited their clothes on a shelf, move forward and line up over the two rows of horizontal numbers in front of the bathhouse entrance. Those numbers were painted yellow.<br><br>K&#x14d;ji noticed the soles of his bare feet were neatly within the circle of the painted number. The inmates who had been standing in exactly the same spot three minutes earlier were now immersed in the bathtub. Steam, billowing out from the bathhouse, faintly enveloped K&#x14d;ji&#x2019;s naked body: the muscles of his lower thorax, sparsely covered with hair, his flat stomach, and, below this, his hanging shame surrounded by a dark tangle of hair. It was a limp, drooping shame, and resembled the carcass of a dead rat caught up among flotsam in a stagnant stream. He considered this: I have converged shame from around the world and acquired this slightly dirty bundle, in much the same way as if I might have acquired a single point of light having converged with a lens the sun&#x2019;s rays.<br><br>He gazed at the ugly backside of the man standing in front of him. The world before his eyes was entirely obscured by ugly, pimple-�covered backs and backsides. The door did not open. The soiled flesh door did not open. Three-�minute-�interval buzzer&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The sound of water. Many backs and backsides began to stir, moving as one through the steam, before plunging into the midst of the great, narrow bathtub. Immersed up to their necks in the tepid, foul-�smelling, murky water, everybody fastened their gaze on the hourglass on the warden&#x2019;s table. The three-�minute flow of fine cinnabar granules appeared and disappeared amid the billowing steam. Bathing, washing, renewed bathing, exit. A red lamp glowed dimly close to the letters &#x201c;Bathing.&#x201d;<br><br>K&#x14d;ji remembered the hourglass clearly, and he recalled the stench of the water as it had clung tenaciously to his body&#x2014;�and the delicate cascade of cinnabar that flowed beyond the steam. He had been fascinated by the strangely quiet way the granules wholeheartedly flowed through the slender glass neck and unceasingly undermined themselves from within. The close-�cropped heads of twenty-�four people floating in the middle of the dirty water. Their grave expressions. Immersed in the water with serious, animal-�like eyes. That&#x2019;s exactly how it was. Among all the trivialities of the prison, there existed something with a marvelously pure sanctity. That hourglass was also sacred. The cinnabar granules ran out. The warden pressed the button, and again the cheerless buzzer sounded. The prisoners stood up all at once, and many wet, hairy thighs advanced toward the duckboards. There was no sanctity at all in the sound of the buzzer&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br><br>The boat sounded its whistle twice. K&#x14d;ji walked in the direction of the wheelhouse and gazed through the glass door at a young steersman wearing short rubber boots and jeans. The steersman sounded the whistle again, pulling with one hand on the white knob of a cord hanging from the ceiling while turning the brightly polished brass steering wheel with the other. The boat made a detour and began its entry into the port of Ukusu. To one side lay a narrow, sprawling, gray town. A Shinto shrine gate appeared as a single spot of red on the round mountaintop. In the harbor, an ore factory&#x2019;s cargo crane extended its arm toward the glaring sea.<br><br>K&#x14d;ji was telling himself, I have repented. I am a different person now. This thought had likely as not been repeated countless times, always with the same rhythm, and as always it took the form of a resounding incantation. I have repented&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In this way, even the freshness of the West Izu coastline became entwined in K&#x14d;ji&#x2019;s penance&#x2014;�the crispness of the scenery itself, the verdure of the mountains, and the very clouds that, in K&#x14d;ji&#x2019;s eyes, appeared to be quite detached from reality. For it was easy to believe that it ought to be so in the eyes of one who had repented. This notion had, like a single bacterium, nested itself in K&#x14d;ji&#x2019;s body one day while he brooded in his cell, surrounded by bars, within the prison walls. And then, in an instant it had reproduced, until his flesh became riddled with remorse, his sweat, too, became the sweat of repentance, even his urine. Even the odor emitted by his youthful body became for K&#x14d;ji the odor of repentance. It was a cold, gloomy, though in some ways also clear and bright&#x2014;�and yet extremely physical&#x2014;�odor. The odor of stable litter for an animal&#x2014;�repentance.<br><br>The ground above the shore gradually took on a yellow tinge with green pine trees dotted here and there, and this changing scenery signaled that the boat, which had left Ukusu, was now approaching Koganezaki. K&#x14d;ji descended a flight of steps and went to the stern. A crowd of children had gathered around one of the ship&#x2019;s crew, who was making a half-�hearted attempt to catch fish. He threaded an artificial fly onto a length of fishing gut, to which he then secured some hemp line before casting the lot far out into the sea. In a flash, the fishing gut leapt out through the air, glittering as it went, and then sank beneath the surface of the water.<br><br>Before long a saury was caught. The fish, which resembled a large horse mackerel, was reeled in, its hard belly thrashing against the unyielding water with a metallic ring. The fish having been landed, K&#x14d;ji no longer felt the urge to watch it as it lay in the man&#x2019;s hand, and he transferred his attention to the sea.<br><br>Over to the left, the bare reddish-�brown cliffs of Koganezaki loomed into sight from around the ship&#x2019;s prow. The sunlight cascaded down from the heavens directly above the cliff top and appeared like a smooth sheet of gold plate as it covered and illuminated every intricate undulation. The sea at the foot of the cliff was especially blue. The bizarre forms of the sharp rocks jostled with one another as they towered up out of the sea, and the swelling, upward-�surging water turned into fine white threads before flowing down again from every crag and corner.<br><br>K&#x14d;ji watched a seagull. It was a magnificent bird. I have repented, I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and he began his reverie once again. The Ry&#x16b;g&#x16b; Maru 20 left Koganezaki behind and, turning in the direction of the next port, Iro, set out intently along the coastal sea lane. The lighthouse at the entrance to Iro harbor gradually came into view on the port side. Along the long narrow bay, the rows of houses and the forested mountains seemed to overlap each other, congealing into a single, flat picture. As the boat came farther into the bay, however, the sense of distance between objects and buildings quickly increased; between the ice-�crushing tower and the ice plant, between the lookout tower and the house rooftops, and the congealed picture increasingly gained perspective as if it had been thinned with hot water. Even the dazzling surface of the inlet seemed to unfold, and the pale reflection of the concrete quay was no longer simply a line of white refined wax.<br><br>Standing slightly apart from those who had come to welcome the boat, a single figure waited under the eaves of the warehouse, a sky-�blue parasol concealing her face. K&#x14d;ji found it difficult to reconcile the vivid, charming image in front of him with the starved vision he had been desperately clinging to for so long. There was no reason to believe he had been starved of sky blue. But if he had been, it would have been the color of repentance.</p><h2>Henry James: Autobiographies (LOA #274): A Small Boy and Others / Notes of a Son and Brother / The Middle Years / Other Writings (Library of America Collected Nonfiction of Henry James)</h2><p><b>The most extensive collection of Henry James's autobiographical writings ever published offers a revelatory self-portrait from one of America's supreme novelists and his famous family.</b> In 1911, deeply affected by the death of his brother William the year before, Henry James began working on a book about his early life. As was customary for James in his later years, he dictated his recollections to his secretary Theodora Bosanquet, who recalled how &#x201c;a straight dive into the past brought to the surface treasure after treasure.&#x201d; <i>A Small Boy and Others </i>(1913) and the two autobiographical books that followed&#x2014;<i>Notes of a Son and Brother </i>(1914) and the incomplete, posthumously published <i>The Middle Years</i>&#x2014;stand with his later novels as one of the enduring triumphs of his final years. Not only did James create one of the singular self-portraits in American literature, he also fashioned a richly detailed account of his renowned family, especially his father, the social philosopher Henry James Sr., his brother William, and his dear cousin Minny Temple, inspiration for the heroines of two of his greatest novels, <i>The Portrait of a Lady </i>and <i>The Wings of the Dove.</i><br>Rounding out the volume is a selection of eight other personal reminiscences and, as an appendix, his secretary&#x2019;s insightful and affectionate memoir, &#x201c;Henry James at Work.&#x201d;<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing.

In other words, a few years after I finished medical school, before I even completed my hospital residency and became a full-fledged member of the medical profession, medical science would have progressed so far as to create a whole new set of rules for taking care of patients.<br><br>Thus began my search for something in medicine that lasts. I wanted to identify some timeless source of healing, the merits of which could never be denied. Not only would this "treatment of choice" outlast the five-year mark but it would have proven value for generations present, for generations past, and for generations to come.<br><br>I will confess that, in part, youthful laziness launched my search. No medical student relishes the idea of having to learn a subject over and over again. But my contemplation of the enduring aspects of human life began in earnest when I was twenty-one, a premed student in college, and had to face the death of my father from rheumatic heart disease. In my mind, science never adequately explained his passing. With their diagrams, definitions, and anatomic drawings, my textbooks couldn't begin to capture the spirit and presence he embodied.<br><br>This was a man who had grown up in the jungles of South America, who came to the United States with only a fourth-grade education, who spoke five languages, and who went on to become a successful businessman in the wholesale and retail produce industry in Yonkers, New York. My father tried to impress upon me and my siblings the importance of "doing things fight." He told us about the time a shopkeeper had had to let him go from his job sweeping up. To finish the job well, my dad was especially thorough cleaning up that night, so the next day the shopkeeper called to tell my father that if he was willing to return, the shopkeeper would find the financial means to keep him on.<br><br>This was what defined my father's life, the same way that family and work, hardships and victories, principles and life lessons define the lives of all human beings. But these matters were rarely addressed in the education I received as a physician -- in the scientific literature, in grand rounds, or even in the training I received at the bedside. And as much as I began to believe that science was all-powerful, snowballing in its ability track and explain life's mysteries, I had a nagging feeling that medicine was missing a critical point.<br><br><b>Accumulating the Evidence</b><br><br>This book traces my steps over thirty years of accumulating evidence of an eternal truth about human physiology and the human experience. Luck, hunches, and happenstance often guided my journey, as with most people's careers. I went from patient to patient, from research study to research study in the same way that all physician-researchers do, unable to predict how each line of inquiry and its corresponding results would contribute to long-term improvements in medicine. But deep down, I always hoped that some immutable wisdom would emerge.<br><br>Partly because my father had died from heart disease, I started my career as a cardiologist. But soon I began to feel inhibited by my specialty, which limited its explorations to keeping chambered organs pumping in patients' chests. Increasingly, I was drawn to mind/body research, and would go on to become one of a handful of medical investigators who established the scientific field recognized today as mind/body medicine.<br><br>Except for a brief training stint in Seattle, and the time I spent in the U.S. Public Health Service in San Juan, Puerto Rico, I've spent my entire career working within Harvard Medical School's teaching hospitals. In 1988, I founded Harvard's Mind/Body Medical Institute at Boston's Deaconess Hospital. Perhaps my most significant contribution to the field was in defining a bodily calm that all of us can evoke and that has the opposite effect of the well-known fight-or-flight response. I call this bodily calm "the relaxation response," a state in which blood pressure is lowered, and heart rate, breathing rate, and metabolic rate are decreased. The relaxation response yields many long-term benefits in both health and well-being and can be brought on with very simple mental focusing or meditation techniques.<br><br>Teaching these methods to patients, health care professionals, and others, I began to realize the power of self-care, the healthy things that individuals can do for themselves. More and more, I became convinced that our bodies are wired to benefit from exercising not only our muscles but our rich inner, human core -- our beliefs, values, thoughts, and feelings. I was reluctant to explore these factors because philosophers and scientists have, through the ages, considered them intangible and unmeasurable, making any study of them "unscientific." But I wanted to try, because, again and again, my patients' progress and recoveries often seemed to hinge upon their spirit and will to live. And I could not shake the sense I had that the human mind -- and the beliefs we so often associate with the human soul -- had physical manifestations.<br><br><b>First Hints of Mind/Body Influence</b><br><br>I had witnessed this firsthand while serving as a merchant seaman the summer after my junior year of college. From the time I read Joseph Conrad as a youth, I was determined to "go to sea." And together with my best friend Howard Rotner, I fulfilled this dream by acquiring this incredible "summer job," which took me across oceans and to ports as diverse as Casablanca, Morocco; Naples, Italy; Piraeus, Greece; Southampton, England; Istanbul and Izmir, Turkey. In these ports, my fellow seamen were fond of barroom bingeing and often returned to the ship with awful hangovers. Knowing that I planned to be a doctor, my suffering shipmates would come to me for relief. But all I had to offer them were vitamins, which I promptly dispensed.<br><br>Though the vitamins should have had little or no effect, my shipmates' symptoms -- and foul moods -- improved rapidly and dramatically after taking the pills. And as word spread of the wondrous results, more and more of my fellow sailors sought me out for my magic pills. But once my indoctrination into medicine began, I found my medical mentors and peers far less interested in this phenomenon. For the first time, I realized there was a great disparity between the things laypeople <i>felt</i> were good for them and those that medical scientists decided <i>were</i> good for them.<br><br>This disparity made me uncomfortable, as did the fact that a diagnosis -- a few words from a doctor -- could dramatically change a patient's view of him- or herself. On the basis of an office visit and a simple test, a doctor could, for example, in diagnosing hypertension, ask a patient to take medication for the rest of his or her life, to endure aggravating side effects, and make major adjustments in diet and lifestyle. Overnight, patients diagnosed with chronic medical problems or illnesses began to think of themselves as "sick," and the effect that label had on their psyches and their physical health was substantial.<br><br>This is what happened to a patient of mine, Antonia Baquero. Before I met her, Ms. Baquero had had calcium deposits removed from her breast, an operation that left a large indentation. The calcium deposits were benign, but her surgeon recommended the operation because of the relatively small chance that a malignant tumor might later develop. The mere suggestion that she might develop cancer frightened Ms. Baquero. "I panicked," she explains. "I decided immediately, in one moment, to have the calcium deposits removed." Later, she regretted the decision. "My body felt cut up. It was a very difficult time in my life. I was trying to juggle business and family. I would wake up at three A.M. and be unable to sleep. There was too much tension."<br><br>Seeking relief from the anxiety and panic that escalated after her surgery, Ms. Baquero happened to pick up my book <i>Your Maximum Mind</i> at the library. Soon after, she came to Boston from her home in New York to see me. I talked with her about the relaxation response and the ways in which this relaxed physical condition could be brought about, or "elicited" as I prefer to say. To elicit the response, I explained that she needed to focus silently on a word or phrase for a period of ten to twenty minutes twice every day, gently brushing aside any everyday thoughts that distracted her to return to her focus. I told her that this was the mental exercise I had shown would dramatically ease the body's usual alert mode of operation, not undermining it, simply letting it calm down and rest for a while while one was awake.<br><br>As so many of my patients do, Ms. Baquero decided to incorporate a religious phrase in this mental focusing exercise. Since I encourage people to pick a focus that pleases them, she adopted a Spanish blessing, <i>"Jesu Christo ayudame, amp�rame y curame,"</i> which means "Jesus Christ, help me, protect me, and cure me." Her mother said a similar blessing to her and her siblings as children before they left for school each day. And over the course of months in which she used this familiar prayer to elicit the relaxation response, Ms. Baquero began to feel liberated from the worry and strain that had bothered her incessantly before. "I started to feel better. I started looking at people and life in a different way. I put less pressure on myself," she says.<br><br>Surely, Ms. Baquero was experiencing the wonderful physical solace of the relaxation response, the opposite effect of the edgy, adrenaline rush we experience in the stress-induced fight-or-flight response. But she also spoke of a more emotional comfort, which the symbolism and meaning of her mother's blessing inspired. The emotional and spiritual balm seemed to affect her as much as the chemical and physical changes that occur during the relaxation response.<br><br>Not only was her body soothing itself but Ms. Baquero seemed to be reclaiming her identity -- the essence of which was called into question when the threat of cancer was introduced to her. Each time she invoked this powerful prayer, she recalled her mother's faith in God's protection, and the faith instilled in her as a child. By introducing this tender comfort into her daily experience, she began to regain confidence both in her body and in herself to face the twists and turns of life.<br><br>Maybe Ms. Baquero's surgeon didn't know that the simple, preventive act of surgery he suggested would cause her so much long-term distress. In our society, doctors often prefer -- and presume that patients want -- to "do something" and "act" to treat or prevent illness or injury. But in Ms. Baquero's case, the diagnosis and the act of "doing something" undermined her faith in the strength of her body. Eliciting the relaxation response with her prayer, she regained a mental equilibrium and undoubtedly helped to ward off disease by doing something to calm her body and her fears.<br><br><b>Remembered Wellness</b><br><br>I learned a lot from these two observations of simple human healing. It turns out that by tracking the contribution a person's desire for health had on his or her health, and by cherishing the right of the individual to choose his or her own outlook, I found the clues of a scientifically profound source of healing. I call this source "remembered wellness." Like my shipmates, all of us project our intense desire for wellness onto the medicine we take. And like Ms. Baquero, all of us have the ability to "remember" the calm and confidence associated with health and happiness, but not just in an emotional or psychologically soothing way. This memory is also physical.<br><br>Remembered wellness isn't particularly mysterious. The evidence of its substantial, positive influence over the body has existed for centuries. It's known in the scientific community as "the placebo effect." But I hope to replace the term with "remembered wellness" not only because it more accurately describes the brain mechanics involved but because "the placebo effect" has become pejorative in medical usage. Members of the medical community often refer to its successes as "just the placebo effect" in much the same way as we tend to dismiss ailments as being "all in your head."<br><br>Most of us think of a placebo as a sugar pill, which, when dispensed by a physician, plays a kind of trick on a patient's mind, producing benefits for the body. And we know that researchers often rely on placebos -- inert substances or procedures -- to contrast results between a control group and those receiving an experimental therapy. But perhaps less well promoted is that an individual's belief empowers the placebo. The fact that the patient, caregiver, or both of them believe in the treatment contributes to better outcomes. Depending on the condition, sometimes affirmative beliefs are all we really need to heal us. Other times we need the collective force of our beliefs and appropriate medical interventions.<br><br>Yet, despite the fact that physicians have always acknowledged this phenomenon, we haven't heralded its efficacy or explored its therapeutic applications. As the ultimate insult, a placebo has often been called a "dummy pill." But the human body, with its propensity to turn a person's beliefs into a physical instruction, is not dumb. I first began reviewing the scientific literature on the placebo effect in the mid-1970s, and shortly thereafter began publishing and speaking on its potential therapeutic benefits. Together with colleagues, I found that in the patient cases we reviewed, the effect I call remembered wellness was 70 to 90 percent effective, doubling and tripling the success rate that had always been attributed to the placebo effect.<br><br>As my research has progressed, I have learned that as long as humans have roamed the earth, we have entertained beliefs. We have always called upon God or gods to sustain us. We have named and given meaning to nearly everything, sometimes simply in our own quiet contemplation of life, sometimes on a larger scale to stir the thoughts of whole populations, as happens in art, literature, and philosophy. We see the world in the unique way our socialization, life experiences, and cultural and religious upbringing permit us to see it. We are not all equally analytical or compelled to find deep meaning in the events of our lives, but we human beings cannot help but color our reality with hopes, emotions, philosophies, and convictions. It is our nature.<br><br>But neurological research reveals that before we consciously color the world around us with our thinking and acquired beliefs, brain mechanisms mark our perceptions, forming opinions and assigning emotional values. Before we even have a chance to mull over the presence of a new sight or sound, regions of our brain react by assigning an initial but influential value to it. These automatic attitudes make us incapable of utter objectivity or neutrality, in more profound ways than we've ever suspected.<br><br>Western science and all of its brilliant discoveries have been built on the tenet that we can and should want to achieve objectivity, and that objective facts can be distinguished from intangible or subjective aspects of life. And because beliefs and emotions are ephemeral and imperceptible, Western medicine has largely assumed that their effects are not physical or measurable. But neurological researchers and those of us delving into the considerable, measurable effects that beliefs can have on the human body are painting a very different portrait of human physiology and human life, with discoveries destined...</p><h2>Mechanical Behavior of Materials (4th Edition)</h2><p><p> <b>For upper-level undergraduate engineering courses in Mechanical Behavior of Materials.</b> </p> <p> <b>&nbsp;</b> </p> <i>Mechanical Behavior of Materials, 4/e</i> introduces the spectrum of mechanical behavior of materials, emphasizing practical engineering methods for testing structural materials to obtain their properties, and predicting their strength and life when used for machines, vehicles, and structures.

For generations it has served as a bedtime story for Indian children, while at the same time engaging the interest of philosophers and theologians. Now this magnificent translation makes the monumental work available to a new audience. <p>Believed to have been composed by Valmiki sometime between the eighth and sixth centuries BC, the Ramayana tells the tragic and magical story of Rama, the prince of Ayodhya, an incarnation of Lord Visnu, born to rid the earth of the terrible demon Ravana. Exiled for fourteen years because of his stepmother&#x2019;s fit of jealousy on the eve of his coronation, Rama enters the forests of Dandaka with his beautiful wife Sita and devoted brother Laksmana. Sita is abducted from the forest by Ravana who takes her to his isolated kingdom on the far side of the southern ocean. The two brothers set out to rescue her and, along the way, make an alliance with a dispossessed monkey, king Sugriva. At the end of a bloody war Ravana is killed and Sita, reunited with her husband, and victorious Rama returns to Ayodhya to claim the throne that is rightfully his.</p><p>An idealized heroic tale ending with the inevitable triumph of good over evil, the Ramayana is also an intensely personal story of family relationships, love and loss, duty and honour, of harem intrigue, petty jealousies and destructive ambitions. All this played out in a universe populated by larger-than-life humans, gods and celestial beings, wondrous animals and terrifying demons.</p><p>In her translation Arshia Sattar has successfully bridged both time and space to make this ancient classic accessible to the present-day English reader.

Netter&#39;s works, this fully illustrated single book from the 8-volume/13-book reference collection includes: hundreds of world-renowned illustrations by Frank H. Netter, MD; informative text by recognized medical experts; anatomy, physiology, and pathology; and diagnostic and surgical procedures.</p><p><p>Frank H. Netter was born in New York City in 1906. He studied art at the Art Students League and the National Academy of Design before entering medical school at New York University, where he received his Doctor of Medicine degree in 1931. During his student years, Dr. Netter&#x2019;s notebook sketches attracted the attention of the medical faculty and other physicians, allowing him to augment his income by illustrating articles and textbooks. He continued illustrating as a sideline after establishing a surgical practice in 1933, but he ultimately opted to give up his practice in favor of a full-time commitment to art. After service in the United States Army during World War II, Dr. Netter began his long collaboration with the CIBA Pharmaceutical Company (now Novartis Pharmaceuticals). This 45-year partnership resulted in the production of the extraordinary collection of medical art so familiar to physicians and other medical professionals worldwide. Icon Learning Systems acquired the Netter Collection in July 2000 and continued to update Dr. Netter&#x2019;s original paintings and to add newly commissioned paintings by artists trained in the style of Dr. Netter. In 2005, Elsevier Inc. purchased the Netter Collection and all publications from Icon Learning Systems. There are now over 50 publications featuring the art of Dr. Netter available through Elsevier Inc.</p> <p>Dr. Netter&#x2019;s works are among the finest examples of the use of illustration in the teaching of medical concepts. The 13-book Netter Collection of Medical Illustrations, which includes the greater part of the more than 20,000 paintings created by Dr. Netter, became and remains one of the most famous medical works ever published. The Netter Atlas of Human Anatomy, first published in 1989, presents the anatomic paintings from the Netter Collection. Now translated into 16 languages, it is the anatomy atlas of choice among medical and health professions students the world over.</p> <p>The Netter illustrations are appreciated not only for their aesthetic qualities, but, more importantly, for their intellectual content. As Dr. Netter wrote in 1949 &#x201c;clarification of a subject is the aim and goal of illustration. No matter how beautifully painted, how delicately and subtly rendered a subject may be, it is of little value as a medical illustration if it does not serve to make clear some medical point. Dr. Netter&#x2019;s planning, conception, point of view, and approach are what inform his paintings and what make them so intellectually valuable.</p> <p>Frank H. Netter, MD, physician and artist, died in 1991.</p></p><h2>Islamic Art: Architecture, Painting, Calligraphy, Ceramics, Glass, Carpets</h2><p><b>This gorgeous survey of art from the Islamic world covers three continents and fourteen centuries.</b><br>From its birth in the seventh century through modern times, the Islamic religion has inspired glorious works of art.

They dominate the look of its art and commodities as well as our discourse about the ambivalent feelings these objects often inspire. In this radiant study, Sianne Ngai offers a theory of the aesthetic categories that most people use to process the hypercommodified, mass-mediated, performance-driven world of late capitalism, treating them with the same seriousness philosophers have reserved for analysis of the beautiful and the sublime.</p><p>Ngai explores how each of these aesthetic categories expresses conflicting feelings that connect to the ways in which postmodern subjects work, exchange, and consume. As a style of performing that takes the form of affective labor, the zany is bound up with production and engages our playfulness and our sense of desperation. The interesting is tied to the circulation of discourse and inspires interest but also boredom. The cute's involvement with consumption brings out feelings of tenderness and aggression simultaneously. At the deepest level, Ngai argues, these equivocal categories are about our complex relationship to performing, information, and commodities.</p><p>Through readings of Adorno, Schlegel, and Nietzsche alongside cultural artifacts ranging from Bob Perelman's poetry to Ed Ruscha's photography books to the situation comedy of Lucille Ball, Ngai shows how these everyday aesthetic categories also provide traction to classic problems in aesthetic theory. The zany, cute, and interesting are not postmodernity's only meaningful aesthetic categories, Ngai argues, but the ones best suited for grasping the radical transformation of aesthetic experience and discourse under its conditions.</p></p><p>Sianne Ngai is Professor of English at Stanford University.<b>Sianne Ngai</b> has written an important book which harks back to the heyday of the leftist literary theory of the 1980s, and is none the worse for that. Dense and demanding, occasionally meandering, [it is] equally at home with <i>I Love Lucy</i> and conceptual art, Theodor Adorno and Jim Carrey... Laudable and ambitious... In order for art to fulfill its role and for criticism to survive, &#x2018;aesthetic theory&#x2019; needs to develop new and powerful concepts which reflect both art&#x2019;s changing nature and its ubiquity. This challenging and important book takes the first steps in this task. (Robert Eaglestone <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> 2013-04-12)<br><br>It&#x2019;s the type of book that contains ideas that are broadly provocative, even for the &#x2018;merely interested.&#x2019; It is one of the most useful guides to the present I&#x2019;ve read in a while, almost despite itself. It offers a way of thinking about so many forms of present-day self-expression, from the prevalence of first-person writing on the Internet to the &#x2018;Like/Share&#x2019;-this cheer of social networks. It helps explain a certain style of art (Tao Lin, for example) that advances on muted, subdued, contingent feelings. (Hua Hsu <i>Slate</i> 2012-12-01)<br><br>[<b>Ngai</b>'s] wide-ranging, synthetic approach is exactly the kind of criticism our ever-accreting culture deserves, and maybe even the criticism we need. By indexing the kinds of feeling-based judgments we make in our daily lives, Ngai opens up questions about how emotions can act in social contexts more generally, how our private experiences might shape our political and economic discourses. (Rebecca Ariel Porte <i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i> 2012-10-14)<br><br><b>Ngai</b> argues that traditional aesthetic concepts of the beautiful and the sublime are inadequate in our post modern hyper-commodifed culture. She&#x2019;s really on to something. (David Collard <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> 2014-06-13)<br><br>A book of immense interest. (Benjamin Lytal <i>Daily Beast</i> 2012-10-24)<br><br><b>Ngai</b> argues that three aesthetic categories usually considered of minor importance are crucial to understanding contemporary culture. The categories in question, the zany, the cute, and the interesting, &#x2018;are best suited for grasping how aesthetic experience has been transformed by the hypercommodified, information-saturated, performance-driven conditions of late capitalism.&#x2019; In defense of this thesis, Ngai deploys a formidable grasp of the aesthetic theories of Schlegel, Nietzsche, Adorno, and Cavell, among many others. Her knowledge of more recent pop culture is equally wide ranging: readers will especially find illuminating her discussion of the zany Lucille Ball. Ngai aims to show how production, circulation, and consumption in contemporary capitalism are mirrored in the cultural world. She argues that the importance of the three marginal categories requires a revision of classical aesthetics. We need not abandon the beautiful and the sublime, but we need to give attention as well to what best enables us to understand today&#x2019;s culture, thus lessening the gap between aesthetic theory and practice... Highly recommended for an academic audience interested in cultural and aesthetic theory. (David Gordon <i>Library Journal</i> 2012-09-01)<br><br><b>Sianne Ngai</b> gives us once again a radiantly idiosyncratic study of that which we never thought to examine and that which we now understand to be crucial to our daily experience as social beings. Under Ngai&#x2019;s quick eye and deft hand, the zany, the cute, and the merely interesting reveal their pertinence for the history and historicity of aesthetic development, the intimacy between quotidian materiality and philosophic inquiry, and the collisions among modernity, art, labor, and performing bodies. (Anne A. Cheng, author of <i>Second Skin</i>)<br><br><b>Sianne Ngai</b>&#x2019;s new book is a major work of aesthetic theory: challenging a beauty-based aesthetics, closing the gap between aesthetic theory and artistic practice, and offering irreverent categories that work across disciplines and periods to make better sense of our cultural experience. <i>Our Aesthetic Categories</i> takes up the mantle of Adorno&#x2019;s <i>Aesthetic Theory</i>, and here Ngai becomes the leading cultural critic of our day. (Jonathan Culler, Cornell University)<br><br>This wonderfully original book (I hesitate to call it &#x2018;cute, zany, and interesting,&#x2019; but that wouldn&#x2019;t be wrong) invents fresh and incisive new categories for that tired old study called aesthetics. Maybe such categories could even transform the field itself, but they certainly transform the way we look at contemporary literature and culture (which <b>Sianne Ngai</b> knows with startling extensiveness), and maybe they will also end up transforming our outlook on the art of the past as well. <i>Our Aesthetic Categories</i> is in any case one of the most exciting new theoretical books to come along in some time. (Fredric Jameson, Duke University)<br><br>With unparalleled originality, ambition, and insight, <b>Sianne Ngai</b> reimagines aesthetic theory for our time. Building on her work in <i>Ugly Feelings</i>, Ngai insists on the significance of minor, ordinary aesthetic experience. <i>Our Aesthetic Categories</i> displaces the centrality of beauty in aesthetics and illuminates the social processes at work in ubiquitous and taken-for-granted acts of judgment. This book will make you feel the present differently.

Dvorak reveals the San Andreas Fault&#x2019;s fascinating history&#x2015;and it&#x2019;s volatile future.</strong></p><p>It is a prominent geological feature that is almost impossible to see unless you know where to look. Hundreds of thousands of people drive across it every day. The San Andreas Fault is everywhere, and primed for a colossal quake. For decades, scientists have warned that such a sudden shifting of the Earth&#x2019;s crust is inevitable. In fact, it is a geologic necessity.</p><p>The San Andreas fault runs almost the entire length of California, from the redwood forest to the east edge of the Salton Sea. Along the way, it passes through two of the largest urban areas of the country&#x2015;San Francisco and Los Angeles. Dozens of major highways and interstates cross it. Scores of housing developments have been planted over it. The words &#x201c;San Andreas&#x201d; are so familiar today that they have become synonymous with earthquake.</p><p>Yet, few people understand the San Andreas or the network of subsidiary faults it has spawned. Some run through Hollywood, others through Beverly Hills and Santa Monica. The Hayward fault slices the football stadium at the University of California in half. Even among scientists, few appreciate that the San Andreas fault is a transient, evolving system that, as seen today, is younger than the Grand Canyon and key to our understanding of earthquakes worldwide.</p> 8 page B&amp;W insert</p><p>Originally trained as a lunar scientist, John Dvorak, PhD, spent twenty years operating a large telescope at Mauna Kea for the Institute for Astronomy, University of Hawaii.&nbsp; His writing has appeared as cover stories for Scientific American, Astronomy and Physics Today.&nbsp; His books include Earthquake Storms and The Last Volcano, both available from Pegasus Books.&#x201c;Much of their enlightenment occurred in California, and the author turns up half a dozen intrepid, eccentric and largely unknown geologists (Grove Gilbert, Andrew Lawson, Charles Richter, Harry Fielding Reid) whose insights began to converge after the devastating 1906 San Francisco earthquake.

When the siblings are accidentally shut in the pyramid, they decide to explore. Using hieroglyphic clues, they discover that the path to the mummy is delineated by "faces," the flat surfaces of geometric solids. As they find either pictures of solid shapes or the objects themselves, the twins count the faces of the shapes and are guided through the pyramid by relating their answers to the hieroglyphic clues. They find the mummy and a map indicating the way out. Although this book attempts to provide an introduction to solid geometry, the information is not clearly presented. The colorful impressionist cartoons depict the various shapes discussed in the text, but they are not labeled. The plot itself is a stretch: before they leave for Egypt, Bibi says she hopes to learn about hieroglyphics, but as soon as she arrives there, she is expert enough to interpret complex messages. An endnote lists some good activities to help children learn about geometric solids, but the story will leave readers more confused than enlightened. Try Stuart J.

We extend our sympathies to his family. </p> <p> Obituary from the <i>Arizona Daily Star</i>: </p> <blockquote><b>STEVENS, W. Richard</b>, noted author of computer books died on September 1. He is best known for his "UNIX Network Programming" series (1990, 1998, 1999), "Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment" (1992), and "TCP/IP Illustrated" series (1994, 1995, 1996). Richard was born in 1951 in Luanshya, Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), where his father worked for the copper industry. The family moved to Salt Lake City, Hurley, New Mexico, Washington, DC and Phalaborwa, South Africa. Richard attended Fishburne Military School in Waynesboro, Virginia. He received a B.SC. in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Michigan in 1973, and an M.S. (1978) and Ph.D. (1982) in Systems Engineering from the University of Arizona. He moved to Tucson in 1975 and from then until 1982 he was employed at Kitt Peak National Observatory as a computer programmer. From 1982 until 1990 he was Vice President of Computing Services at Health Systems International in New Haven, CT, moving back to Tucson in 1990. Here he pursued his career as an author and consultant. He was also an avid pilot and a part-time flight instructor during the 1970's.<p> He is survived by his loving wife of 20 years, Sally Hodges Stevens; three wonderful children, Bill, Ellen and David; sister, Claire Stevens of Las Vegas, NV; brother, Bob and wife Linda Stevens of Dallas, TX; nieces, Laura, Sarah, Collette, Christy; and nephew, Brad. He is predeceased by his parents, Royale J. Stevens (1915-1984); and Helen Patterson Stevens (1916-1997). Helen lived in Tucson from 1991-1997, and Royale lived here in the early 1930's attending Tucson High School while his father was treated for TB at the Desert Sanitorium (now TMC). The family asks that in lieu of flowers, donations be made in Richard's name to Habitat for Humanity, 2950 E. 22nd Street, Tucson, AZ 85713. A memorial service for Richard will be held at St. Phillip's in the Hills Episcopal Church on Tuesday, September 7th at 12:00 noon. Following the service there will be a reception in the Murphy Gallery of the Church. Please wear colorful clothing to the service; Richard loved colors.</p></blockquote> <p><b>W.

Woolfolk, the horoscope columnist for Marie Claire and Redbook magazines, has updated her classic guide for the first time in 19 years. Thoroughly covered here are sun signs, moon signs, planets, and the significance of the 12 zodiacal houses, as well as the most recent discoveries in astronomy and 21st-century projections. The author gives an easy, logical way to integrate the interpretations of the sun signs, moon signs, planets, and houses in any given chart, something not easily done or often seen in general astrology books. The book's only shortcoming is its lack of instruction on making a detailed technical chart, which is necessary if one is to cast a complete and accurate horoscope. However, Woolfolk compensates for this by teaching a simplified method that is about 90 percent accurate enough to get a beginner started and includes a bibliography for further instruction. Astronomical tables are included to help cast the simplified chart. A great bargain for the price, this is highly recommended for all astrology collections.

Christopher Haigh's lively and readable study disproves any facile assumption that the triumph of Protestantism was inevitable, and goes beyond the surface of official political policy to explore the religious views and practices of ordinary English people. With the benefit of hindsight, other historians have traced the course of the Reformation as a series of events inescapably culminating in the creation of the English Protestant establishment. Haigh sets out to recreate the sixteenth century as a time of excitement and insecurity, with each new policy or ruler causing the reversal of earlier religious changes.

Reading level: 2.4.<b>Charles Dickens</b> (1812-1870) was born in Portsmouth, England, and spent most of his life in London. When he was twelve, his father was sent to debtor&#x2019;s prison and he was forced to work in a boot polish factory, an experience that marked him for life. He became a passionate advocate of social reform and the most popular writer of the Victorian era.</p><h2>One Writer&#39;s Beginnings</h2><p><p> Now available as an audio CD, in Eudora Welty's own voice, or as a book. </p><p> Eudora Welty was born in 1909 in Jackson, Mississippi. In a "continuous thread of revelation" she sketches her autobiography and tells us how her family and her surroundings contributed to the shaping not only of her personality but of her writing. Homely and commonplace sights, sounds, and objects resonate with the emotions of recollection: the striking clocks, the Victrola, her orphaned father's coverless little book saved since boyhood, the tall mountains of the West Virginia back country that become a metaphor for her mother's sturdy independence, Eudora's earliest box camera that suspended a moment forever and taught her that every feeling awaits a gesture. She has recreated this vanished world with the same subtlety and insight that mark her fiction. </p><p> Even if Eudora Welty were not a major writer, her description of growing up in the South--of the interplay between black and white, between town and countryside, between dedicated schoolteachers and the public they taught--would he notable. That she is a splendid writer of fiction gives her own experience a family likeness to others in the generation of young Southerners that produced a literary renaissance. Until publication of this book, she had discouraged biographical investigations. It undoubtedly was not easy for this shy and reticent lady to undertake her own literary biography, to relive her own memories (painful as well as pleasant), to go through letters and photographs of her parents and grandparents. But we are in her debt, for the distillation of experience she offers us is a rare pleasure for her admirers, a treat to everyone who loves good writing and anyone who is interested in the seeds of creativity. </p></p><p>Among the most beloved of American writers, Eudora Welty&#39;s stories and novels have entertained us for over half a century. Here, in her memoirs, she writes with her usual candor and grace about how a writer&#39;s sensibilities are shaped. As compelling as her stories, as witty as her personality, as finely honed as her fiction, Welty&#39;s account of her life is a powerful and fulfilling read.<b>Eudora Welty</b>'s many honors include the Pulitzer Prize; the American Book Award for fiction; and the Gold Medal for the Novel, given by the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters for her entire work in fiction.</p><h2>Doing Christian Ethics from the Margins: 2nd Edition Revised and Expanded</h2><p>A revised and expanded edition of the text that presents a justice-based ethics that avails itself of the perspectives and experiences of those on the margins.</p><p><b>The Rev.

Her many honors include the Washington Post/Children's Book Guild Nonfiction Award and the NSTA Outstanding Science Trade Book Award.Grade 2-4-- Young naturalists will be captivated by this succinctly written, well-organized, brightly illustrated introduction to monarch butterflies. Focusing on a single monarch, the text describes each stage of its metamorphosis, basic physical and behavioral characteristics, diet, and migratory instincts. It then discusses the migration patterns of the species in general, mentions the celebrations held in their honor along the migration route, and ends with simple instructions for raising a butterfly in a jar. (The text instructs readers to pound holes in a jar lid with a hammer and a nail--no safety warning or suggestion to obtain adult help is given.) The last page consists of additional miscellaneous facts. Clear, stylized color drawings accompany the short blocks of text on every page; each is doubly framed by white and yellow backgrounds. There are a number of titles available on the life cycles of butterflies; however, most are on a slightly higher reading level and describe different species.

The high skills of the surveyors, artists, and engravers who delineated the topography and fields of battle allow us to observe the unfolding of events that ultimately defined the United States.</p><p>When warfare erupted between Britain and her colonists in 1775, maps provided graphic news about military matters. A number of the best examples are reproduced here, including some from the personal collections of King George III, the Duke of Northumberland, and the Marquis de Lafayette. Other maps from institutional and private collections are being published for the first time. In all, sixty significant and beautiful cartographic works from 1755 to 1783 illustrate this intriguing era.</p><p>Most books about the Revolution begin with Lexington and Concord and progress to the British surrender at Yorktown, but in this rich collection the authors lay the groundwork for the war by also taking into account key events of the antecedent conflict. The seeds of revolution were planted during the French and Indian War (1755&#x2013;1763), and it was then that a good number of the participants, both British and rebel, cut their teeth. George Washington took his first command during this war, alongside the future British commanding General Thomas Gage.</p><p>At the Treaty of Paris, the French and Indian War ended, and King George III gained clear title to more territory than had ever been exchanged in any other war before or since. The British military employed its best-trained artists and engineers to map the richest prize in its Empire. They would need those maps for the fratricidal war that would begin twelve years later. Their maps and many others make up the contents of this fascinating and beautiful book.</p> 60 maps</p><p><p><strong>Richard H.

I was constantly active starting at a young age, thanks in large part to my dad--he&#x2019;s the one who introduced me to soccer, and he later coached my high school team. (I still play competitively, and I even met my husband on the soccer field. He&#x2019;s also a personal trainer and fellow fitness freak.) My dad was always moving, whether it was tackling a 150-mile bike ride or opting for the stairs over the elevator. Our lifestyle wasn&#x2019;t simply about being athletic--it was about being active.</p><p>As a teenager, I was eager to finish high school. I knew I wanted to share my passion for fitness with all kinds of people, so I graduated at sixteen and became a certified trainer within two years. By this point, I had honed the &#x201c;lean&#x201d; part of my clean and lean philosophy: The more you move, the more you stay lean. It was simple and clearly effective--all anyone had to do was look at my dad&#x2019;s and my trim physiques, which we attributed to our active lifestyle. I preached this motto often.</p><p>But I was also eager to keep challenging myself physically. So when I was twenty, I enlisted in the Marines, and I served two tours in Iraq between 2003 and 2005. The day before I was scheduled to leave for my second deployment, a group of friends and family gathered at my parents&#x2019; house for a going-away cookout. At one point, my dad walked over to my mom and told her that his chest hurt. The two of them went inside, and she turned around to get something for him--and that&#x2019;s when he suddenly fell over and died. Instantly. The doctors later told us that he was dead before he even hit the ground. Within three minutes, he went from feeling ill to suffering a fatal heart attack.</p><p>My dad was just fifty-two when he passed away. He had been trim and strong his whole life--he&#x2019;d thrived on being physically active--and he&#x2019;d never had any major health issues. So how did this happen? The answer was crushing: for more than five decades, he had eaten whatever he wanted, whenever he wanted. He&#x2019;d never been told to watch his diet, to eat certain foods, and to avoid certain others. For me, it was the hardest way to learn that being thin doesn&#x2019;t necessarily mean being healthy</p><p>My father&#x2019;s sudden death changed everything for me. After I took ten days of military emergency leave, duty called. It was heartbreaking to leave my family--especially my mom--when the pain was still so fresh, but I had to follow through on my commitment and return to Iraq.</p><p>Upon arriving, I threw myself into work. This was 2004, and Fallujah had been shut down. When Iraqi citizens were finally being let back in the city, every individual had to be searched. Men weren&#x2019;t allowed to physically touch the women, so the Marines&#x2019; first-ever all-female platoon was created--and my superiors appointed me as the sergeant to train and lead that search force. One of my main duties was to look for suicide bombers, contraband, and guns at various checkpoints around Fallujah. It was intense--and I loved every minute of it. I actually tried to extend my stay, but my commanding officer made me come home.</p><p>After returning to Nashville, I finally started to process my dad&#x2019;s death. My way of doing this was by learning everything I could about food and how it affects your body. I took nutrition seminars, experimented endlessly with recipes, and eventually became certified as a nutrition coach. One of my biggest revelations was that I began to see food as fuel for your body--not as a reward or as a hobby--and I set out to discover the most efficient ways to use it. The answer, in short, is to maintain a diet with as many whole foods and as few processed foods as possible. Fresh fruits and vegetables, lean meats, legumes, nuts--these are what your body should be running on. My findings ultimately became the &#x201c;clean&#x201d; part of my clean and lean philosophy.</p><p>Over the next few years, I began training elite clients and instilling in them the virtues of being clean and lean--not just one or the other. In my own kitchen, I continued to experiment with all kinds of recipes and ingredients, working toward the cleanest and best-tasting diet possible. The process is ever-evolving, but I&#x2019;ve pinned down four key eating habits: cutting out starches at night and cutting back on your sugar, sodium, and alcohol intake. Practicing all four of these habits regularly has produced the most dramatic effects on my own body and my clients&#x2019; bodies. Meanwhile, I also discovered an innovative four-minute workout called tabata that shocked me with its (science-backed) effectiveness.&nbsp;</p><p>Grabbing onto the &#x201c;4&#x201d; element of each discovery, I developed the 4 � 4 Diet. The combination of these four clean eating habits and four-minute workouts has been a game-changer for me as well as for my clients, who span just about every age, body type, and fitness level. Listen, I am always excited to eat healthy and try new exercises. It&#x2019;s my job, it&#x2019;s my passion, and it&#x2019;s also my lifestyle. But the 4 � 4 Diet has gotten my clients--people who have struggled with weight loss and motivation for years--to be excited to clean up their diet and work out. And now I want to share it with you.</p></p><h2>Children&#39;s Ministry Volunteers That Stick</h2><p>It's tough to recruit volunteers--so hang on to those you've got!

Anna Sewell&#39;s moving story is one of the best-loved animal adventures ever written.</p><p>Anna Sewell was born in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, England, on March 30, 1820. Brought up in a strict Quaker family, Anna developed a strong interest in horses as a young girl. But a crippling bone disease and a fall in 1834 left her an invalid for most of her life. By her mid-thirties she was severely lame and could only get around in a pony cart, and characteristically she would never use a whip on the animal. In 1871, she was told she had eighteen months to live, and by the end of that year, she had begun her book, <b>Black Beauty</b>, hoping it might make people a little kinder to their faithful horses. Although she was seriously ill, she lived long enough to finish her book and see it published in 1877. On April 25, 1878, she died at her home in Old Catton near Norwich, England. <b>Black Beauty</b>, an enormous success from its first appearance, was soon adopted by the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and used to improve the conditions of horses everywhere.<br>Meg Rosoff was born in Boston, USA.

The &#x201c;millennium&#x201d; edition of Tolstoy fills a hundred volumes and weighs as much as a newborn beluga whale. (I brought my bathroom scale to the library and weighed it, ten volumes at a time.) Dostoevsky comes in thirty volumes, Turgenev in twenty-eight, Pushkin in seventeen. Even Lermontov, a lyric poet killed in a duel at age twenty-seven, has four volumes. It&#x2019;s different in France, where definitive editions are printed on &#x201c;Bible paper.&#x201d; The Biblioth�que de la Pl�iade manages to fit Balzac&#x2019;s entire Human Comedy in twelve volumes, and his remaining writings in two volumes, for a combined total weight of eighteen pounds.The Collected Works of Isaac Babel fills only two small volumes. Comparing Tolstoy&#x2019;s Works to Babel&#x2019;s is like comparing a long road to a pocket watch. Babel&#x2019;s best-loved works all fit in the first volume: the Odessa, Childhood, and Petersburg cycles; Red Cavalry; and the 1920 diary, on which Red Cavalry is based. The compactness makes itself felt all the more acutely, since Babel&#x2019;s oeuvre is known to be incomplete. When the NKVD came to his dacha in 1939, Babel&#x2019;s first words were, &#x201c;They didn&#x2019;t let me finish.&#x201d; The secret police seized and confiscated nine folders from the dacha, and fifteen from Babel&#x2019;s Moscow apartment. They seized and confiscated Babel himself, on charges of spying for France and even Austria. Neither manuscripts nor writer were seen again.In the next years, Babel&#x2019;s published works were removed from circulation. His name was erased from encyclopedias and film credits. Rumors circulated&#x2014;Babel was in a special camp for writers, he was writing for the camp newspaper&#x2014;but nobody knew for sure if he was dead or alive. In 1954, the year after Stalin&#x2019;s death, Babel was officially exonerated, and the dossier of his criminal case made public. Inside was just one page: a certificate attesting to his death, under unknown circumstances, on March 17, 1941. Like Sherlock Holmes in &#x201c;The Adventure of the Final Problem,&#x201d; Babel had vanished, leaving behind a single sheet of paper.Nobody really knows why Babel was arrested when he was. He had made powerful enemies early in his career with the publication of the Red Cavalry stories, which immortalize the botched Russo-Polish military campaign of 1920. In 1924, Commander Semyon Budyonny of the First Cavalry publicly accused Babel of &#x201c;counterrevolutionary lies&#x201d; and character assassination. In later years, as Budyonny rose in the Party system, from marshal of the Soviet Union to first deputy commissar for defense and Hero of the Soviet Union, Babel found himself on increasingly thin ice&#x2014;especially after the death of his protector, Maxim Gorky, in 1936. Nonetheless, he survived the height of the Great Purge in 1937&#x2013;38, and was arrested only in 1939, when World War II was just around the corner and Stalin presumably had bigger fish to fry. What tipped the scale?The Nazi-Soviet pact might have played a role: because of Babel&#x2019;s close ties with the French Left, his continued existence was necessary to maintain Soviet-French diplomatic relations&#x2014;which became a moot point once Stalin sided with Hitler. Some evidence suggests that Babel was arrested in preparation for one last show trial that was to accuse the entire intellectual elite, from the film legend Sergei Eisenstein to the polar explorer Otto Schmidt, but which was called off in September when Hitler invaded Poland.Some scholars attribute Babel&#x2019;s arrest to his bizarre relationship with the former people&#x2019;s commissar Nikolai Yezhov: Babel had had an affair in the 1920s with Evgeniya Gladun-Khayutina, Yezhov&#x2019;s future wife, and it was said that, even in the 1930s, Babel would visit the couple at home where they would all play ninepins and listen to Yezhov tell gruesome stories about the gulag. When Lavrenty (&#x201c;Stalin&#x2019;s Butcher&#x201d;) Beria came to power in 1938, he made a point of exterminating anyone who had ever had anything to do with Yezhov.Others insist that Babel was arrested &#x201c;for no reason at all,&#x201d; and that to say otherwise is to commit the sin of attributing logic to the totalitarian machine.When Babel&#x2019;s box in the KGB archives was declassified in the 1990s, it became known that the warrant for his arrest had been issued thirty-five days after the fact. Following seventy-two hours of continuous interrogation and probably torture, Babel had signed a confession testifying that he had been recruited into a spy network in 1927 by Ilya Ehrenburg and for years systematically supplied Andr� Malraux with the secrets of Soviet aviation&#x2014;the last detail apparently borrowed from Babel&#x2019;s late screenplay, Number 4 Staraya Square (1939), which chronicles the byzantine intrigues among scientists in a plant devoted to the construction of Soviet dirigibles.&#x201c;I am innocent. I have never been a spy,&#x201d; Babel says in the transcript of his twenty-minute &#x201c;trial,&#x201d; which took place in Beria&#x2019;s chambers. &#x201c;I accused myself falsely. I was forced to make false accusations against myself and others . . . I am asking for only one thing&#x2014;let me finish my work.&#x201d; Babel was executed by firing squad in the basement of the Lubyanka on January 26, 1940, and his body was dumped in a communal grave. Nineteen forty, not 1941: even the death certificate had been a lie.The first time I read Isaac Babel was in a college creative writing class. The instructor was a sympathetic Jewish novelist with a Jesus-like beard, an affinity for Russian literature, and a melancholy sense of humor, such that one afternoon he even &#x201c;realized&#x201d; the truth of human mortality, right there in the classroom. He pointed at each of us around the seminar table: &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to die. And you&#x2019;re going to die. And you&#x2019;re going to die.&#x201d; I still remember the expression on the face of one of my classmates, a genial scion of the Kennedy family who always wrote the same story, about a busy corporate lawyer who neglected his wife. The expression was confused.In this class we were assigned to read &#x201c;My First Goose,&#x201d; the story of a Jewish intellectual&#x2019;s first night at a new Red Army billet during the 1920 campaign. Immediately upon his arrival, his new comrades, illiterate Cossacks, greet him by throwing his suitcase in the street. The intellectual, noticing a goose waddling around the billet, steps on its neck, impales it on a saber, and orders the landlady to cook it for his dinner. The Cossacks then accept him as one of their own and make room for him at the fireside, where he reads them one of Lenin&#x2019;s speeches from a recent issue of Pravda.When I first read this story in college, it made absolutely no sense to me. Why did he have to kill that goose? What was so great about sitting around a campfire, reading Lenin? Among the stories we read in that class, Chekhov&#x2019;s &#x201c;Lady with Lapdog&#x201d; moved me much more deeply. I especially remember the passage about how everyone has two lives&#x2014;one open and visible, full of work, convention, responsibilities, jokes, and the other &#x201c;running its course in secret&#x201d;&#x2014;and how easy it is for circumstances to line up so that everything you hold most important, interesting, and meaningful is somehow in the second life, the secret one. In fact, this theme of a second, secret life is extremely important to Babel, but I didn&#x2019;t figure that out until later.The second time I read Babel was in graduate school, for a seminar on literary biography. I read the 1920 diary and the entire Red Cavalry cycle in one sitting, on a rainy Saturday in February, while baking a Black Forest cake. As Babel immortalized for posterity the military embarrassment of the botched 1920 Russo-Polish campaign, so he immortalized for me the culinary embarrassment of this cake, which came out of the oven looking like an old hat and which, after I had optimistically treated it with half a two-dollar bottle of Kirschwasser, produced the final pansensory impression of an old hat soaked in cough syrup.There are certain books that one remembers together with the material circumstances of reading: how long it took, the time of year, the color of the cover. Often, it&#x2019;s the material circumstances themselves that make you remember a book that way&#x2014;but sometimes it&#x2019;s the other way around. I&#x2019;m sure that my memory of that afternoon&#x2014;the smell of rain and baking chocolate, the depressing apartment with its inflatable sofa, the sliding glass door that overlooked rainy palm trees and a Safeway parking lot&#x2014;is due to the precious, almost-lost quality of Babel&#x2019;s 1920 diary.The diary starts on page fifty-five&#x2014;Babel lost the first fifty-four pages. Three days later, another twenty-one pages go missing&#x2014;a month&#x2019;s worth of entries. &#x201c;Slept badly, thinking of the manuscripts,&#x201d; Babel writes. &#x201c;Dejection, loss of energy, I know I will get over it, but when?&#x201d; For the next couple of days, despite all his efforts, everything reminds him of the lost pages: &#x201c;A peasant (Parfenty Melnik, the one who did his military service in Elisavetpol) complains that his horse is swollen with milk, they took away her foal, sadness, the manuscripts, the manuscripts . . .&#x201d;The diary isn&#x2019;t about war, but about a writer during a war&#x2014;about a writer voraciously experiencing war as a source of material. Viktor Shklovsky, who invented the theory that literary subject material is always secondary to literary form, was a great admirer of Babel. &#x201c;He wasn&#x2019;t alienated from life,&#x201d; Shklovsky wrote. &#x201c;But i...</p><h2>Laura&#39;s Album: A Remembrance Scrapbook of Laura Ingalls Wilder (Little House Nonfiction)</h2><p><p>Though best known as the author of the Little House books, Laura Ingalls Wilder led a full, rich life that spanned almost a century of American history.

The ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DESIGNS FOR QUILTING by Phyllis D. Miller is the first comprehensive reference of traditional quilting designs. Quiltmakers, quilt documentors, and historians/researchers will find this book a valuable tool. Phyllis documented 375 traditional quilting designs from texts and quilt collections. For quiltmakers, the front section of the book is a how-to guide with over 500 illustrations for drawing and transferring traditional designs onto quilt tops. Some of the diagrams are: straight lines, geometrics and triangles; squares and circles; diagonals and diamonds; ovals, crescents, and curves; ropes and cables; hearts and feathers; and representational, naturalistic, designs taken from a quilt pattern, and combination designs. In the back section, the Numerical Index has numbers assigned to the designs for easy documentation and reference. Phyllis&#39;s quilt designs have helped her win numerous awards in quilt competitions. You&#39;ll find the tools in the ENCYCLOPEDIA FOR DESIGNS FOR QUILTING will help you create your own designs and make your quilts ribbon winners, too!</p><p>Phyllis D. Miller has been making quilts since the summer of 1968. She has made numerous quilts and wallhangings since that beginning. Her quilts have been exhibited and won awards on the local, state, and national levels. Phyllis graduated from Berea College, Berea, Kentucky, in 1963 with a B.S. in business administration. She is well known in the quilt world as a teacher and for her organizational abiltities. She is an active supporter and member of the Kentucky Heritage Quilt Society and is currently the museum and archives committee chairman. In this capacity, she oversees the Kentucky Quilt Registry which is an ongoing documentation project. Her duties in this position include training volunteers to register the quilts of Kentucky at Quilt Registry days that are held in the counties of the state. She is past president of the Kentucky Heritage Quilt Society and was the editor of the KHQS newsletter. She is the founder of the Kentucky Heritage Applique Society, a KHQS auxillary group. Phyllis feels that one of her most rewarding accomplishments was starting Quilter&#39;s Day Out in Kentucky so that quilters would have one day each year when they could be together. This was a way to bring a statewide organization to the quilters. This day of celebration was later declared National Quilting Day by the National Quilting Association and is now celebrated around the world. She is a member of the National Quilting Association and is a past first vice president and assistant treasurer. She was president and treasurer of the Murray Quilt Lovers and is a member of the Paducah Quilt &#39;n Sew On group. Phyllis&#39;s favorite parts of quilting are designing the quilt and choosing an appropriate design for the quilting of the piece. She promotes using creative and innovative quilting designs to make every quilt unique. She makes both traditional and contemporary quilts, often combining both ideas in one quilt.Miller, an experienced quilter who has been closely involved with the Kentucky Quilt Registry documentation project, here sets out to categorize quilting designs by shape, to assign names to the designs based on their use in the literature of quilting, and to teach the best methods for drawing and marking the designs on a quilt top.

His boots are white, including the thick leather soles, and his hands are encased in white gloves. The only items of color upon his body are the pair of gold starbursts--one on each of the short square collars of his tunic.<br>A dark-haired boy wearing shimmering gray trousers and a short-sleeved shirt of the same shimmering fabric holds the man&#x2019;s left hand. Both walk along a corridor. The floors, walls, and ceiling are all of white granite,<br>except for one window of a glass-like substance so dark it appears nearly black. The black window is on the man&#x2019;s right, exactly halfway between the two metal doors, each also of shimmering white metal.<br>When the pair reaches the window, the man halts, bends, and lifts the boy, holding him so that their heads are almost even with each other. The man inclines his head toward the dark expanse of glass. &#x201c;There. There is the First Tower.&#x201d;<br>The dark-haired youth, his amber eyes shielded by the ancient dark glass, stares at the glittering trapezoid of light beyond the wall. The dark transparency filters out all that lies beyond the wall except for the blistering light that is the Tower.<br>&#x201c;One day,&#x201c; says the man, &#x201c;one day, Lorn&#x2019;elth...you and your brother will be Magi&#x2019;i of the Rational Stars. One day, you will direct the workings of Towers of Light to harness the power of chaos and to continue to bring peace and prosperity to Cyad and to all of Cyador.&#x201d;<br>Abruptly, the boy shivers, then stiffen.s, though his eyes do not leave the chaos light of the Tower.<br>&#x201c;To be of the Magi&#x2019;I--it is a long and difficult struggle.&#x201d; The man smiles at his son, and even his sun-golden eyes smile. &#x201c;But as you grow older, you will see that it is worth the effort, for nothing compares to the glory that is Cyad, and the peace and the grace of her people.&#x201d;<br>The magus slowly lowers Lorn&#x2019;elth to the polished white stone floor and takes his son&#x2019;s hand once more. They continue along the corridor to the second door, where the father raises his hand. A flicker of golden energy flashes from a point just beyond his gloves to the door. Then he slides the door into its recess--to his left. The two enter the second corridor, and the magus closes the door behind them.<br>Another window awaits them midway down the second white stone corridor.<br>At this window, the man again lifts his son, speaking softly as he does. &#x201c;You will be the ones who will transfer the pure chaos energy from the towers to the fireships, to the firewagons, and to the firelances of Cyador. You will ensure that the fair city remains so, and that her people bless the Emperor and the Magi&#x2019;i of the Rational Stars.&#x201d;<br>Serious-eyed, the boy watches through the darkened glass--not so dark as that in the first corridor--as the six-wheeled firewagon rolls silently into the shimmering enclosure that flanks the chamber holding the mighty tower. Figures scurry and remove the square cells from the rear of the vehicle, replacing them with other cells that almost glitter. Then the fire-wagon rolls out, and another rolls in and halts.<br>&#x201c;This is the heart of Cyad, and Cyador, and it can be yours, Lorn&#x2019;elth.&#x201d; The father lowers his son once more. &#x201c;It will be yours.&#x201d;<br>The two return as they came, their heavy boots whispering but slightly on the hard stone of the corridor.<br>Copyright � 2000 by L.

One is a working-class girl from Manchester, the other a Scottish aristocrat; one is a pilot, the other a wireless operator. Yet whenever their paths cross, they complement each other perfectly, and before long they are devoted friends. But then a vital mission goes wrong, and one of the friends has to bail out of a faulty plane over France. She is captured by the Gestapo and becomes a prisoner of war. The story begins in "Verity's" own words, as she writes her account for her captors.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Teen Books of the Month, May 2012</strong>: Rich in historical detail and intrigue, <i>Code Name Verity</i> is a vivid reminder of what makes historical fiction so compelling. In exchange for a temporary stay of execution and lesser forms of torture, a young female spy captured in Nazi-occupied France writes a confession of her activities in the Resistance. Her story is that of two women who should never have crossed paths, yet were destined to become the best of friends and embark upon the covert mission that would determine which of them would live or die.

It is, without question, a profound statement by God about his own sovereignty and majesty spoken through his chosen spokesman, the prophet Isaiah.</p><p>In this expository commentary on the book of Isaiah, Raymond C. Ortlund, Jr., argues that Isaiah imparts a single vision of God throughout all sixty-six chapters. It is a unified, woven whole presenting God's revelation of himself to mankind, breaking through our pretense and clashing "with our intuitive sense of things." Ortlund makes a point of man's uninterest in God and his unfailing inclination to disbelief, and thus the need for God to "interrupt our familiar ways of thinking."</p><p>The emphasis of this addition to the Preaching the Word series is this: God saves sinners. He saves them willfully and powerfully and needs no help from us, presenting himself in all his unmistakable glory. The message of Isaiah, shown thoroughly and thoughtfully in this commentary, will reignite a passion for the glory of God in the hearts of believers and will present that glory clearly and potently to those who have yet to be brought to saving faith.&nbsp;Part of the Preaching the Word series.</p></p><p>Raymond C.

Arabs, even in Medina, loved their golf, after all, and no one had given any of the cases a second look. </p><p> Finally assembled and secured to its launching platform, the second-generation TOW 2 Short missile was something to behold. Though it retained the same three-foot ten-inch profile of the ones Israel had used during the 1973 Yom Kippur War, the effective range of the weapon had increased by almost a thousand yards, and was now the length of forty-one football fields -- more than enough to deliver today's deadly payload. </p><p> The missile's optical sighting unit was securely positioned in the adjoining hotel room, and its crosshairs were fixed upon its target. An infrared sensor would track the weapon's trajectory and progress, relaying any last-minute adjustments. At such close range though, there'd be no need for adjustments. It would be like shooting fish in a barrel. </p><p> The digital fuse was set for ten minutes into the night prayer session of the Prophet's Mosque, the second-holiest shrine in Islam. Friday was the most important day of worship in the Muslim faith, and the evening prayer sessions were always the most heavily attended. The timing of the attack insured maximum carnage. With a Do Not Disturb sign hung on the doors of both rooms, the terrorist would be resting comfortably on a first-class flight to Cairo by the time the missile launched. From Cairo, a clandestine transport network would round out the journey home just as today's events were being broadcast on the evening news. </p><p> As the digital fuse began its devastating countdown, the terrorist spray-painted a large hand cradling the Star of David on the wall. </p><p> For a moment, scenes of a happier time flashed through the terrorist's mind. A time before the hatred was so deeply entrenched. Two young lovers from different walks of life, two different sides of the struggle, walked together along a river in fall. Bells rang in the distance and they cherished the good fortune that had brought them together. Though each had been raised to hate the other, love had blossomed between them. But, there were influences at work greater than their love. It was those influences that would change their lives, and the world, forever. </p><p> The terrorist's eyes, normally silver in color, now flashed coal black with hate as the final letters were painted beneath the hand. It was a simple, yet chilling three-word message, "Terror For Terror." </p><p> Two hours later, a stream of worshippers hurried themselves along, late for the sunset prayer. As they entered the Prophet's Mosque, right leg first as custom dictated, each supplicated, saying, "I seek refuge with the Mighty Allah. I seek protection in His Generous Countenance and His Everlasting Authority....O Allah! Forgive my sins, and open the gates of Your mercy to me." </p><p> They fanned out deeper into the mosque, searching for empty spaces to kneel among the other thousands of worshippers. As was the custom, the women were directed into a separate area closed off by large panels of fabric, so as not to distract the men from their prayers. The younger children stayed with their mothers, while older sons, well behaved enough not to disrupt the service, were allowed to sit among the rows of adult men. Most of the families in the Prophet's Mosque were divided this way when a great rumbling erupted overhead and a massive double-detonating warhead crashed through the roof, exploding in a fiery hail of instant death. </p><p> By noon the next day, rescue workers were giving up any hope of finding victims alive beneath the wreckage of the Prophet's Mosque. As throngs of Medina's citizens gathered behind emergency-services barricades asking <i>why</i>, a broadcast fax went simultaneously to newspapers and news agencies around the globe. It read: </p><p> </p><blockquote>For decades, the Arab world has supported and encouraged terrorism against Israel. Publicly, terrorists are denounced, while privately they continue to be trained and financed by Arab nations. The nation of Israel will no longer tolerate acts of violence upon our soil, or against our people. Henceforward we will speak to the Arab world in the language they have given birth to, the language they have spat bitterly into our mouths, the only language they understand -- the language of terrorism. <p> As it says in Job -- "They that plow iniquity and sow mischief shall reap the same."</p></blockquote> <p> The fax was signed on behalf of an organization calling itself the <i>Hand of God</i>. Beneath the group's name was the same pictogram the Medina police found on the wall of room 611 of the Dar Al Taqwa Inter-Continental, a large hand holding the Star of David in its palm. </p><p> The operation had begun. </p><p> </p><p> Copyright � 2003 by Brad Thor</p></p><h2>The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Parents are Going Broke</h2><p>In this revolutionary expos�, Harvard Law School bankruptcy expert Elizabeth Warren and financial consultant Amelia Tyagi show that today's middle-class parents are increasingly trapped by financial meltdowns. Astonishingly, sending mothers to work has made families more vulnerable to financial disaster than ever before. Today's two-income family earns 75% more money than its single-income counterpart of a generation ago, but has 25% less discretionary income to cover living costs. This is "the rare financial book that sidesteps accusations of individual wastefulness to focus on institutional changes," raved the <i>Boston Globe</i>. Warren and Tyagi reveal how the ferocious bidding war for housing and education has silently engulfed America's suburbs, driving up the cost of keeping families in the middle class. The authors show why the usual remedies-child-support enforcement, subsidized daycare, and higher salaries for women-won't solve the problem. But as the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> observed, "The book is brimming with proposed solutions to the nail-biting anxiety that the middle class finds itself in: subsidized day care, school vouchers, new bank regulation, among other measures." From Senator Edward M. Kennedy to Dr. Phil to Bill Moyers, <i>The Two-Income Trap</i> has created a sensation among economists, politicians, and families-all those who care about America's middle-class crisis.</p><p><b>Elizabeth Warren</b> is the Leo Gottlieb Professor of Law at Harvard Law School. She is the co-author of <i>As We Forgive Our Debtors</i> and <i>The Fragile Middle Class</i>, as well as three leading commercial law casebooks. She is vice-president of the American Law Institute, and served as Chief Advisor to the National Bankruptcy Review Commission. She lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.<br><br><b>Amelia Warren Tyagi</b> has worked as an Engagement Manager with McKinsey and Company, specializing in health care, insurance, and education, and she co-founded the successful healthcare start-up HealthAllies. She lives in Pacific Palisades, California, with her husband and two-year-old daughter, Octavia.Warren, a law professor at Harvard (The Fragile Middle Class) and her daughter Tyagi, a former McKinsey consultant, have joined forces here to argue here that the two-parent middle-class working family is on the brink of financial disaster. The number of families declaring bankruptcy or receiving a foreclosure against their house has shot up dramatically. Presenting carefully researched economic data to support their arguments, the authors contend that, contrary to popular myth, families aren't in trouble because they're squandering their second income on luxuries. On the contrary, both incomes are almost entirely committed to necessities, such as home and car payments, health insurance and children's education costs. When an unforeseen event such as serious illness, job loss or divorce occurs, families have no discretionary income to fall back on. The authors recommend a number of useful societal solutions to get families out of this trap, such as legally prohibiting credit card companies from charging grossly unfair interest rates and exposing banks that employ a loan-to-own strategy that steers minority customers to higher mortgage rates with an eye to future foreclosures. Warren and Tyagi point out that families buy homes they cannot afford in order to live in a neighborhood with better schools. Their proposed solution, however-to institute a public school voucher system with wider choice-is less carefully thought out. Overall, however, this is a needed examination of an emerging social problem.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Battlefield of the Mind</h2><p>Battlefield of the Mind</p><p>Joyce Meyer ha estado ensenando la Palabra de Dios desde 1976 y en un ministerio de tiempo completo desde 1980.

At age 5, he decided to become a priest. </p><p>However, between the changes of the Vatican II council and the hypocrisy of many of the clergy he encountered in college, he began to seek in other paths. Due partially to the influence of liberal professors at the minor seminary, he studied spiritualism, ESP and ultimately white witchcraft. By the time he had his bachelor's degree, he was a full-fledged witch (Wiccan). </p><p>From there, his spiritual path took some even stranger turns. </p><p>Since witches believe that there really are no spiritual guidelines beyond the Wiccan Rede: "An it harm none, do what ye will." Bill and his wife (high priestess) continued to investigate various lines of occult power. </p><p>Through much travel and also trance channeling, they came in contact with supposedly high "Spiritual Masters" (both physical and astral beings), who told them that different currents of power were necessary to totally fulfill them as authentic seekers on the Path of Wisdom. These included Freemasonry, cultural spiritualism (Voodoo, etc.) Thelema (the Aleister Crowley cult), Rosicrucianism, the Catholic priesthood, Mormonism, and various Eastern philosophies. </p><p>Ultimately, through a gradual seduction process which promised them ever greater wisdom, they were led into the Church of Satan, and then "underground Satanism." </p><p>This process took almost 16 years. </p><p>Because of their belief in the necessity of excelling in all these different disciplines, Bill and his wife, Sharon, achieved very high levels of training in most of the above systems. Though it may be difficult for the lay person to understand how anyone could be deceived enough to become involved in so many bizarre belief systems, the occult mind-set finds little contradiction in getting into many different forms of spirituality, since it is believed that "All gods are one god and all goddesses are one goddess and there is but one Initiator." </p><p>Only through Jesus Christ and His saving work on the cross could Bill and Sharon be set free and come to understand that Jesus is the ultimate source of all wisdom (Col. 2:3) and power (Matt. 28:18) and that He alone can bring us into contact with the true and living God (John 14:6). </p><p>Today, Bill and Sharon operate With One Accord Ministries, and provide counseling to many people who seek deliverance from the occult. </p><p>Books written by William Schnoebelen: </p><p>Masonry, Beyond the Light Wicca Lucifer Dethroned Blood on the Doorposts</p></p><h2>Shock Wave (Large Print) (A Virgil Flowers Novel)</h2><p>John Sandford&#39;s Shock Wave starts off with a bang when a bomb goes off in the headquarters of superstore chain PyeMart, killing a secretary.

Accompanied by both an old associate and a runaway heiress, Isabella must brave oppressive heat, merciless fevers, palace intrigues, gossip, and other hazards in order to satisfy her boundless fascination with all things draconian, even if it means venturing deep into the forbidden jungle known as the Green Hell . . . where her courage, resourcefulness, and scientific curiosity will be tested as never before.</p></p><p><p>MARIE BRENNAN is an anthropologist and folklorist who shamelessly pillages her academic fields for material.

I made the trip from Pasterway on a regular basis, as I had affairs to monitor in the city. Those trips, however, were not well-publicized&#x2014;by which I mean I mentioned them to only a handful of people, all of them discreet. So far as most of Scirland knew (those few who cared to know), I was a recluse, and had been so since my return from Vystrana. <br>I was permitted reclusiveness on account of my personal troubles, though in reality I spent more of my time on work: first the publication of our Vystrani research, and then preparation for this Erigan expedition, which had been delayed and delayed again, by forces far beyond our control. On that Graminis morning, however, I could no longer escape the social obligations I assiduously buried beneath those other tasks. The best I could do was to discharge them both in quick succession: to visit first my blood relations, and then those bound to me by marriage. <br>My house in Pasterway was only a short drive from the fashionable district of Havistow, where my eldest brother Paul had settled the prior year. I usually escaped the necessity of visiting his house by the double gift of his frequent absence and his wife&#x2019;s utter disinterest in me, but on this occasion I had been invited, and it would have been more trouble to refuse. <br>Please understand, it is not that I disliked my family. Most of us got on cordially enough, and I was on quite good terms with Andrew, the brother most immediately senior to me. But the rest of my brothers found me baffling, to say the least, and my mother&#x2019;s censure of my behaviour had nudged their opinions toward disapproval. What Paul wanted with me that day I did not know&#x2014;but on the whole, I would have preferred to face a disgruntled Vystrani rock-wyrm. <br>Alas, those were all quite far away, while my brother was too near to avoid. With a sensation of girding for battle, I lifted my skirt in ladylike delicacy, climbed the front steps, and rang the bell. <br>My sister-in-law was in the morning room when the footman escorted me in. Judith was a paragon of upper-class Scirling wifehood, in all the ways I was not: beautifully dressed, without crossing the line into gyver excess; a gracious hostess, facilitating her husband&#x2019;s work by social means; and a dedicated mother, with three children already, and no doubt more to come. <br>We had precisely one thing in common, which was Paul. &#x201c;Have I called at the wrong time?&#x201d; I inquired, after accepting a cup of tea. <br>&#x201c;Not at all,&#x201d; Judith answered. &#x201c;He is not at home just now&#x2014;a meeting with Lord Melst&#x2014;but you are welcome to stay until he returns.&#x201d; <br>Lord Melst? Paul <i>was</i> moving up in the world. &#x201c;I presume this is Synedrion business,&#x201d; I said. <br>Judith nodded. &#x201c;We had a short respite after he won his chair, but now the affairs of government have moved in to occupy his time. I hardly expect to see him between now and Gelis.&#x201d; <br>Which meant I might be cooling my heels here for a very long time. &#x201c;If it is not too much trouble,&#x201d; I said, putting down my teacup and rising from my seat, &#x201c;I think it might be better for me to leave and come back. I have promised to pay a visit to my brother-in-law Matthew today as well.&#x201d; <br>To my surprise, Judith put out her hand to stop me. &#x201c;No, please stay. We have a guest right now, who was hoping to see you&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>I never had the chance to ask who the guest was, though I had my suspicions the moment Judith began to speak. The door to the sitting room opened, and my mother came in. <br>Now it all made sense. I had ceased to answer my mother&#x2019;s letters some time before, for my own peace of mind. She would not, even when asked, leave off criticizing my every move, and implying that my bad judgment had caused me to lose my husband in Vystrana. It was not courteous to ignore her, but the alternative would be worse. For her to see me, therefore, she must either show up unannounced at my house&nbsp;&#x2026; or lure me to another&#x2019;s. <br>Such logic did little to sweeten my reaction. Unless my mother was there to offer reconciliation&#x2014;which I doubted&#x2014;this was a trap. I had rather pull my own teeth out than endure more of her recriminations. (And lest you think that a mere figure of speech, I should note that I <i>did</i> once pull my own tooth out, so I do not make the comparison lightly.) <br>As it transpired, though, her recriminations were at least drawing on fresh material. My mother said, &#x201c;Isabella. What is this nonsense I hear about you going to Eriga?&#x201d; <br>I have been known to bypass the niceties of small talk, and ordinarily I am grateful for it in others. In this instance, however, it had the effect of an arrow shot from cover, straight into my brain. &#x201c;What?&#x201d; I said, quite stupidly&#x2014;not because I failed to understand her, but because I had no idea how she had come to hear of it. <br>&#x201c;You know perfectly well what I mean,&#x201d; she went on, relentlessly. &#x201c;It is <i>absurd,</i> Isabella. You cannot go abroad again, and <i>certainly</i> not to any part of Eriga. They are at war there!&#x201d; <br>I sought my chair once more, using the delay to regain my composure. &#x201c;That is an exaggeration, Mama, and you know it. Bayembe is not at war. The mansa of Talu dares not invade, not with Scirling soldiers helping to defend the borders.&#x201d; <br>My mother sniffed. &#x201c;I imagine the man who drove the Akhians out of Elerqa&#x2014;after two hundred years!&#x2014;dares a great deal indeed. And even if <i>he</i> does not attack, what of those dreadful Ikwunde?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The entire jungle of Mouleen lies between them and Bayembe,&#x201d; I said, irritated. &#x201c;Save at the rivers, of course, and Scirland stands guard there as well. Mama, the whole point of our military presence is to make the place safe.&#x201d; <br>The look she gave me was dire. &#x201c;Soldiers do not make a place safe, Isabella. They only make it less dangerous.&#x201d; <br>What skill I have in rhetoric, I inherited from my mother. I was in no mood to admire her phrasing that day, though. Nor to be pleased at her political awareness, which was quite startling. Most Scirling women of her class, and a great many men, too, could barely name the two Erigan powers that had forced Bayembe to seek foreign&#x2014;which is to say Scirling&#x2014;aid. Gentlemen back then were interested only in the lopsided &#x201c;trade agreement&#x201d; that sent Bayembe iron to Scirland, along with other valuable resources, in exchange for them allowing us to station our soldiers all over their country, and build a colony in Nsebu. Ladies were not interested much at all. <br>Was this something she had attended to before, or had she educated herself upon hearing of my plans? Either way, this was not how I had intended to break the news to her. Just how I <i>had</i> intended to do it, I had not yet decided; I kept putting off the issue, out of what I now recognized as rank cowardice. And this was the consequence: an unpleasant confrontation in front of my sister-in-law, whose stiffly polite expression told me that she had known this was coming. <br>(A sudden worm of suspicion told me that Paul, too, had known. Meeting with Lord Melst, indeed. Such a <i>shame</i> he was out when I arrived.) <br>It meant, at least, that I only had to face my mother, without allies to support her in censure. I was not fool enough to think I would have had allies of my own. I said, &#x201c;The Foreign Office would not allow people to travel there, let alone settle, if it were so dangerous as all that. And they <i>have</i> been allowing it, so there you are.&#x201d; She did not need to know that one of the recurrent delays in this expedition had involved trying to persuade the Foreign Office to grant us visas. &#x201c;Truly, Mama, I shall be at far more risk from malaria than from any army.&#x201d; <br>What possessed me to say that, I do not know, but it was sheer idiocy on my part. My mother&#x2019;s glare sharpened. &#x201c;Indeed,&#x201d; she said, and the word could have frosted glass. &#x201c;Yet you propose to go to a place teeming with tropical diseases, without a single <i>thought</i> for your son.&#x201d; <br>Her accusation was both fair and not. It was true that I did not think as much of my son as one might expect. I gave very little milk after his birth and had to hire a wet-nurse, which suited me all too well; infant Jacob reminded me far too much of his late namesake. Now he was more than two years old, weaned, and in the care of a nanny. My marriage settlement had provided quite generously for me, but much of that money I had poured into scientific research, and the books of our Vystrani expedition&#x2014;the scholarly work under my husband&#x2019;s name, and my own inane bit of travel writing&#x2014;were not bringing in as much as one might hope. Out of what remained, however, I paid handsomely for someone to care for my son, and not because the widow of a baronet&#x2019;s second son ought not to stoop to such work herself. I simply did not know what to do with Jacob otherwise. <br>People often suppose that maternal wisdom is wholly instinctual: that however ignorant a woman may be of child rearing prior to giving birth, the mere fact of her sex will afterward endow her with perfect capability. This is not true even on the grossest biological level, as the failure of my milk had proved, and it is even less true in social terms. In later years I have come to understand children from the perspective of a natural historian; I know their development, and have some appreciation for its marvellous progress. But at that point in time, little Jacob made less sense to me than a dragon. <br>Is the rearing of a child best performed by a woman who has done it before, who has honed her skills over the years and enjoys her work, or by a woman with no skill and scant enjoyment, whose sole qualification is a direct biological connection? My opinion fell decidedly on the former, and so I saw very little practical reason why I should not go to Eriga. In <i>that</i> respect, I had given a great deal of thought to the matter of my son. <br>Saying such things to my mother was, however, out of the question. Instead I temporized. &#x201c;Matthew Camherst and his wife have offered to take him in while I am gone. Bess has one of her own, very near the same age; it will be good for Jacob to have a companion.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And if you die?&#x201d; <br>The question dropped like a cleaver onto the conversation, severing it short. I felt my cheeks burning: with anger, or with shame&#x2014;likely both. I was outraged that my mother should say such a thing so bluntly&nbsp;&#x2026; and yet my husband had died in Vystrana. It was not impossible that I should do the same in Eriga. <br>Into this dead and bleeding silence came a knock on the door, followed shortly by the butler, salver in hand, bowing to present a card to Judith, who lifted it, mechanically, as if she were a puppet and someone had pulled the string on her arm. Confusion carved a small line between her brows. &#x201c;Who is Thomas Wilker?&#x201d; <br>The name had the effect of a low, unnoticed kerb at the edge of a street, catching my mental foot and nearly causing me to fall on my face. &#x201c;Thomas Wil&#x2014;what is <i>he</i> doing here?&#x201d; Comprehension followed, tardily, lifting me from my stumble. Judith did not know him, and neither did my mother, which left only one answer. &#x201c;Ah. I think he must be here to see me.&#x201d; <br>Judith&#x2019;s posture snapped to a rigid, upright line, for this was <i>not</i> how social calls were conducted. A man should not inquire after a widow in a house that wasn&#x2019;t hers. I spared a moment to notice that the card, which Judith dropped back on the salver, was not a proper calling card; it appeared to be a piece of paper with Mr. Wilker&#x2019;s name written in by hand. Worse and worse. Mr. Wilker was not, properly speaking, a gentleman, and certainly not the sort of person who would call here in the normal course of things. <br>I did what I could to retrieve the moment. &#x201c;I do apologize. Mr. Wilker is an assistant to the earl of Hilford&#x2014;you recall him, of course; he is the one who arranged the Vystrani expedition.&#x201d; And was arranging the Erigan one, too, though his health precluded him from accompanying us. But what business of that could be so urgent that Lord Hilford would send Mr. Wilker after me at my brother&#x2019;s house? &#x201c;I should speak with him, but there&#x2019;s no need to trouble you. I will take my leave.&#x201d; <br>My mother&#x2019;s outstretched hand stopped me before I could stand. &#x201c;Not at all. I think we&#x2019;re all eager to hear what this Mr. Wilker has to say.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Indeed,&#x201d; Judith said faintly, obeying the unspoken order woven through my mother&#x2019;s words. &#x201c;Send him in, Londwin.&#x201d; <br>The butler bowed and retired. By the alacrity with which Mr. Wilker appeared, he must have sprang forward the instant he was welcomed in; agitation still showed in his movements. But he had long since taken pains to cultivate better manners than those he had grown up with, and so he presented himself first to Judith. &#x201c;Good morning, Mrs. Hendemore. My name is Thomas Wilker. I&#x2019;m sorry to trouble you, but I have a message for Mrs. Camherst. We must have passed one another on the road; I only just missed her at her house. And I&#x2019;m afraid the news is unfortunate enough that it could not wait. I was told she would be visiting here.&#x201d; <br>The curt, disjointed way in which he delivered these words made my hands tighten in apprehension. Mr. Wilker was, quite rightly, looking only at Judith, save a brief nod when he spoke my name; with no hint forthcoming from him, I found myself exchanging a glance instead with my mother. <br>What I saw there startled me. <i>We&#x2019;re all eager to hear what this Mr. Wilker has to say</i>&#x2014;she thought he was my lover! An overstatement, perhaps, but she had the expression of a woman looking for signs of inappropriate attachment, and coming up empty-handed. <br>As well she should. Mr. Wilker and I might no longer be at loggerheads the way we had been in Vystrana, but I felt no romantic affection for him, nor he for me. Our relationship was purely one of business. <br>I wanted to set my mother down in no uncertain terms for harboring such thoughts, but forbore. Not so much because of the sheer inappropriateness of having that conversation in public, but because it occurred to me that Mr. Wilker and I were engaged in <i>two</i> matters of business, of which the Erigan expedition was only one. <br>Judith, fortunately, waved Mr. Wilker on before I could burst out with my questions unbidden. &#x201c;By all means, Mr. Wilker. Or is your message private?&#x201d; <br>I would not have taken the message privately for a hundred sovereigns, not with such suspicions in my mother&#x2019;s mind. &#x201c;Please,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;What has happened?&#x201d; <br>Mr. Wilker blew out a long breath, and the urgency drained from him in a sudden rush, leaving him sagging and defeated. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s been a break-in at Kemble&#x2019;s.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Kemble&#x2019;s&nbsp;&#x2026; oh, no.&#x201d; My own shoulders sagged, a mirror to his. &#x201c;What did they destroy?

Someone knew what Kemble was working on, and was determined to steal it for their own. <br>I slumped back in my chair, ladylike dignity the furthest thing from my mind. Frederick Kemble was the chemist Mr. Wilker had hired&#x2014;or rather <i>I</i> had hired; the money was mine, although the choice of recipient was his&#x2014;to continue the research we ourselves had stolen in the mountains of Vystrana, three years ago.

In song, film, and live performances by stars such as Billy Crystal, Kevin Spacey, and John Lithgow, the audience relived a time some fifty years before, when, as the story has always been told, courageous writers and actors stood firm against a witch-hunt and blacklist that wrecked lives and destroyed careers. Left untold that night, and ignored in books and films for more than half a century, was a story not so politically correct but vastly more complex and dramatic.<br>In <b><i>Hollywood Party</i></b> the complete story finally emerges, backdropped by the great upheavals of our time and with all the elements of a thriller&#x2014;wrenching plot twists, intrigue, betrayal, violence, corruption, misguided passion, and lost idealism. Using long neglected information from public records, the personal files of key players, and recent revelations from Soviet archives, <b>Kenneth Lloyd Billingsley</b> uncovers the Communist Party's strategic plan for taking control of the movie industry during its golden age, a plan that came perilously close to success. He shows how the Party dominated the politics of the movie industry during the 1930s and 1940s, raising vast sums of money from unwitting liberals and conscripting industry luminaries into supporting Stalinist causes.<br>In riveting detail, the shameful truth unfolds: Communist writers, actors, and directors, wealthy beyond the dreams of most Americans, posture as proletarian wage slaves as they try to influence the content of movies. From the days of the Popular Front through the Nazi-Soviet Pact and beyond World War II, they remain faithful to a regime whose brutality rivaled that of Hitler's Nazis.<br>Their plans for control of the industry a shambles by the mid-1950s, the Party nonetheless succeeded in shaping the popular memory of those days. By chronicling what has been left on the cutting-room floor, from "back story" to aftermath, <b><i>Hollywood Party</i></b> changes those perceptions forever.<br>"Mr. Billingsley's book is the best exploration I've seen of the Hollywood blacklist and the Communist Party's role in that conflict. <i>Hollywood Party</i> covers it all with insight, meticulous research, and some wry perceptions."<br><br><b>&#x2014;Charlton Heston</b><br>"For years we've been treated to the left-wing version of the Hollywood blacklist. Now Lloyd Billingsley has provided us with the rest of the story."<br><br><b>&#x2014;David Horowitz, author of <i>Radical Son</i></b><br>"Now the whole story can be told; the blacklist was never black and white after all, but can only be depicted accurately in shades of gray. From this day forward, no future backstage history of Hollywood can be called complete without taking into account the evidence that Lloyd Billingsley has uncovered."<br><br><b>&#x2014;Gary McVey, film curator, former director of the Los Angeles International Film Festival</b><br>"<i>Hollywood Party</i> is an absolutely captivating achievement."<br><br><b>&#x2014;Richard Grenier, columnist and author of <i>Capturing the Culture</i></b><br><b>About the Author<br><br>Kenneth Lloyd Billingsley</b> is the editorial director of the Pacific Research Institute in San Francisco. He has served as California correspondent for the <i>Spectator</i> (London) and written for the <i>Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Daily News, San Francisco Chronicle,</i> and many other publications. He currently divides his time between Sacramento, the Bay Area, and Southern California.</p><p>Here's what most people know about the clash between Washington, D.C., and Hollywood involving Communist influence over the film industry: the House Committee on Un-American Activities led an organized witch hunt against writers and actors with left-wing sympathies, creating an environment that led to a blacklist destroying many talented people's careers. But some insist this isn't the whole story. "It's a false parallel. Witch hunt!" wrote Molly Kazan, whose husband Elia testified before the committee, saved his career as a film director, and earned enmity from Hollywood liberals continuing to the present day. "The phrase would indicate that there are no Communists in the government, none in the big trade unions, none in the press, none in the arts.... No one who was in the Party and the left uses that phrase. They know better."<p> Kenneth Lloyd Billingsley works to fill in some of the historical gaps with <i>Hollywood Party</i>. The information on the role of Communist (and Communist- sympathetic) screenwriters is not particularly revelatory to those familiar with the basic outlines of the story, although Billingsley pushes the Communist angle hard, noting the Party's lockstep support of Stalin and what might charitably be called his "policies," as well as the vicious backlash against any leftist who spoke out against the Communists. His chronicle of Communist efforts to control the studio workers' unions, however, illuminates a less glamorous but perhaps more substantial aspect of the story. Those in search of celebrity dirt will be mildly disappointed; there are several star-studded scenes, but mostly mild anecdotes on the level of Ronald Reagan's gradual realization that, as an SAG activist, he was being played for a dupe by the Reds. Unless, that is, Billingsley is writing about a Communist or a fellow traveler, in which case no personal quirk, from screenwriter Dalton Trumbo's penchant for working in his bathtub to Bertolt Brecht's lack of hygiene to left-wing journalist Ella Winter's mannishly short hair, is overlooked. <i>-- Ron Hogan</i></p>Kenneth Lloyd Billingsley is the editorial director of the Pacific Research Institute in San Francisco.

It embraces a wide range of social milieux, from the miseries of the tenements to the cultivated, bourgeois Bradshaws. It introduces a memorable cast of characters: the main protagonist, Fitz, a model of the hard-working, loyal and abused trade unionist; the isolated, well-meaning and ineffectual Fr O&#39;Connor; the wretched and destitute Rashers Tierney. In the background hovers the enormous shadow of Jim Larkin, Plunkett&#39;s real-life hero. Strumpet City&#39;s popularity derives from its realism and its naturalistic presentation of traumatic historical events. There are clear heroes and villains. The book is informed by a sense of moral outrage at the treatment of the locked-out trade unionists, the indifference and evasion of the city&#39;s clergy and middle class and the squalor and degradation of the tenement slums.</p><p>The late James Plunkett drew on his city-centre working-class background, and his commitment to the labour movement, as the background for his fiction. Strumpet City is acknowledged as his masterpiece. His other novels include Farewell Companions and The Circus Animals. He was an accomplished short-story writer and also wrote for radio and theatre.`Plunkett&#39;s seminal book provided a graphic depiction of a major event in a flawed society, which was ultimately a conflict between two sets of values - the values of the slum, interdependence and collective solidarity versus the values of the quick buck&#39; -- SIPTU President, Jack O&#39;Connor `Many studies have been written about the quest for the Great American Novel. Anyone seeking its Irish equivalent need search no further.&#39; Eileen Battersby, The Irish Times If there is one novel that bares the soul of Dublin as much as the &#39;life-in-one-day&#39;of Ulysses, it is James Plunkett&#39;s Strumpet City. -- Donal O&#39;Donoghue * RTE *</p><h2>Field of Dishonor (Honor Harrington Series, Book 4)</h2><p>Captain Honor Harrington returns home to Manticore, where she is caught up in an unexpected political crisis and becomes the target of revenge for her enemy, Pavel Young, whom she helped get dismissed from the navy</p><p>David Weber is author of the New York Times bestselling Honor Harrington series as well as In Fury Born, The Apocalypse Troll, Wind Rider&#x2019;s Oath, the Safehold series and many other popular bestsellers. Torch of Freedom, a previous Honorverse novel by David Weber and Eric Flint, was selected by Publishers Weekly as a Best Book of the Year, and both Torch of Freedom and Cauldron of Ghosts were New York Times bestsellers. Weber and his wife Sharon and their three children live in South Carolina.The fourth Honor Harrington novel is definitely the best in this increasingly popular military-sf series. Honor's old nemesis, Pavel Young, takes revenge on her for having him dismissed from the navy by hiring a duelist to kill her lover. This swiftly brings upon him a dire and vividly described fate, which puts Honor on half-pay on the planet Grayson, where she is a feudal magnate. Honor has always been as much a descendant of the Superperson as of C. S. Forester's very human Horatio Hornblower, but Weber has thought enough about her so that, when the time came to produce a character-driven military-sf novel, he could do so quite handsomely. That time is now, and these are a new Honor and a new Weber. With the war against the People's Republic of Haven clearly destined to last as long as the Napoleonic Wars after which it is modeled, expect to see more of both. <i>Roland Green</i></p><h2>Times Three</h2><p>Selected verse from three decades, with 70 new poems.

King</b></p> <p><strong>Louise Penny Biography:</strong> Louise Penny is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of eight Chief Inspector Gamache novels, which have won the New Blood Dagger, Macavity, Nero, Arthur Ellis, Barry, Agatha, Dilys, and Anthony Awards. She lives with her husband in Qu�bec, where she is at work on her next novel. </p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> <i> Garment of Shadows</i> is the twelfth book in the Mary Russell series (along with the e-short story, <i>Beekeeping for Beginners</i>). How has Mary evolved for you from your first novels? Has she surprised you in any ways? </p> <p><strong>A:</strong> <i>The Beekeeper's Apprentice</i> was intended as a coming-of-age novel, in which a brilliant young mind grows into its own under the guidance of an equally brilliant, if unlikely, tutor: one Sherlock Holmes. That book set the stage for a life (and a relationship) that has circled the globe both physically and metaphorically, and over the decade of their adventures, she has definitely evolved. </p> <p> As for surprising me, I'm the kind of writer who researches closely, plots vaguely, and then dives in and follows the characters as they meet the challenges of the time and place. I positively depend on my characters surprising me. </p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> A big part of your mysteries is the globetrotting element. What has led you to set your mysteries in so many places? </p> <p><strong>A:</strong> It isn&#x2019;t just that it gives me an excuse to travel. Honestly. </p> <p> Sherlock Holmes is English: specifically, a Londoner. Sherlock Holmes is also solitary, accompanied only by Dr. Watson. When I started writing Holmes, I envisioned him as a supporting actor, but soon found myself exploring his character, forcing him outside his stereotypes and making demands on him that Conan Doyle never did: a Victorian in a post-WWI world; a solitary man in a serious relationship; an Englishman in foreign lands. </p> <p> And I was fascinated to find how he both developed and remained true to himself. Sherlock Holmes as a travelling magician in rural India, or a Bedouin in Palestine, is both the same man and intriguingly different. </p> <p> Their travel also puts Russell on a more level plane with him, since even if he&#x2019;s familiar with the country, she has the advantage of youth&#x2019;s natural flexibility to adapt. </p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> How do you approach the historical relevancy of the time period and place? How much of the Arab Spring has influenced <i>Garment of Shadows</i>? </p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Historical fiction is both a window and a mirror. My readers are people who love to learn about other times and places (and yes, I am a compulsive researcher!). Yet without the reflection of our own concerns and experiences, a historical novel has as much appeal as a stack of 3&#x201d;x5&#x201d; cards. </p> <p> As a writer, my primary task is to entertain. But we writers are sly, and we have deeper goals. We aim to leave the reader thinking, just a little, about these different yet oddly familiar people. </p> <p> While I was writing <i>Garment of Shadows</i>, which draws in part on the 1920s Moroccan independence movement, the crowds gathered in Tahrir Square: no doubt that awareness wove its way into the story, just as the story now will weave its way into the minds of its readers. A novel is an entertainment, but it is also a mirror giving a new perspective on the world. </p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> If you could grant Russell and Holmes one modern convenience in solving their mysteries, what would it be? </p><p></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Holmes would leap at the Internet, gloating over all the world's information at his fingertips. Russell, on the other hand, would love cell phones&#x2014;she's forever wondering what on earth Holmes is up to. </p> <p> Would it be cheating to give them both smart phones? </p><b>Laurie R.

He was the first European to enter the capital of Somaliland and the first to discover the Great Lakes of Central Africa. He was also an Orientalist of the first rank.<br>But it is for his pilgrimage in 1853 to Mecca and Medina and the most sacrosanct shrines of Islam that Burton is best known &#x2014; and for his celebrated book that recorded his experiences during the journey. Successfully posing as a wandering dervish, he gained admittance to the holy Kaabah and to the Tomb of the Prophet at Medina and participated in all the rituals of the Hadj (pilgrimage). He is still one of the very few non-Moslems to visit and return from Mecca.<br>Above all, Burton was a sharp observer &#x2014; of character, customs, and physical surroundings. These pages contain a treasury of material on Arab life, beliefs, manners and morals; detailed descriptions of religious ceremonies, mosques, temples, etc.; and a variety of ethnographic, economic, and geographical information. Whether telling of the crowded caravan to Mecca, engaging in minute analysis of Bedouin character, waxing lyrical about a desert landscape, or reporting conversations with townsfolk or fellow pilgrims, Burton gives us a vivid picture of the region and its people.<br>Along with his thorough familiarity with the cultures and languages of the Middle East, Burton exhibited a resourcefulness and presence of mind that were to serve him well along the way. These qualities saw him through many a taut situation in a country where violence was easily kindled. And they permitted him to get to and into places a man with less enterprise would never have dreamed of going.<br>This book&#x2019;s value to historians of culture and religion, Orientalists, and other scholars is obvious. Yet it is as a great classic of travel that it has attracted such a wide audience. Burton&#x2019;s highly personal style, vigorous opinions, and his matter-of-fact humor against a backdrop of constant hazard and possible exposure have delighted tens of thousands of readers for more than a century. This reprint gives today&#x2019;s readers an opportunity to enjoy this unique work.</p><p></p><h2>Heimsuchung (German Edition)</h2><p>Publisher: BTB (2010) ISBN: 9783442738946</p><p></p><h2>Dreamtime and Inner Space: The World of the Shaman</h2><p>Collection of reports from men and women who have taken mystical journeys in an altered state of consciousness.</p><p>f reports from men and women who have taken mystical journeys in an altered state of consciousness.Holger Kalweit is a German ethnologist and psychologist who has studied shamanism in Hawaii, the American Southwest, Mexico, and Tibet.

Proposing instead that kitsch is the product of a larger sensibility of loss, Celeste Olalquiaga shows how it enables the momentary re-creation of experiences that exist only as memories or fantasies. Simultaneously exposing and celebrating this process, Olalquiaga gives us a bold, trenchant analysis of what and how we see when we look at kitsch.<br><br>Tracing its beginnings to the nineteenth century--when industrialization transformed nature into an artificial kingdom of miniature scale--Olalquiaga describes the at once exhilarated and melancholic atmosphere where kitsch came to life. In an arresting mix of theory and anecdote, she examines objects from both the past and the present, probing the fluid boundaries between reality and fantasy, and finding in kitsch a phenomenon as relevant to our own time as it was to the era that made it a massive experience.</p><p>If you thought kitsch was as simple as sweatshirts embossed with sparkling kittens or flamingo snow domes, think again. Celeste Olalquiaga has gone well beyond Webster's definition of "pretentious bad taste," and devotes more than 300 pages to the subject. Her thesis? <blockquote>Kitsch is the ability to surpass essential belongings and rest in more superficial ones, to create an imaginary landscape through accumulation and camouflage, and to crystallize the continuous movement of life in the permeable disguise of fantasy.</blockquote> The Ph.D.-wielding Rockefeller and Guggenheim award winner postulates that the Victorian era and the industrial revolution of the late 19th century were the grandparents of kitsch. People stuffed their homes with fantasy-themed tchotchkes to fill the "existential emptiness brought about by rapid industrialization." From "petrified nature" and "melancholia artificialis" to "vegetable jewelry" and "parlor oceans," <i>The Artificial Kingdom</i> covers every historical nuance of tackydom and leaves no postmodern paperweight unturned."Kitsch is the ability to surpass essential belongings and rest in more superficial ones, to create an imaginary landscape through accumulation and camouflage, and to crystallize the continuous movement of life in the permeable disguise of fantasy." from <i> The Artificial Kingdom</i></p><h2>Goddess: The Secret Lives of Marilyn Monroe</h2><p>She was born Norma Jeane but the world knew and loved her as Marilyn.

Drawing on first-hand interviews Anthony Summers offers both a classic biography and a shockingly revealing account of the screen goddess&#39;s relations with John and Robert Kennedy. &#39;The definitive story of the legend ...more convincing at every page - told with all the coldness of truth and the authority of the historian, but at the end of it we still love Marilyn&#39; Maeve Binchy, Irish Times</p><p>Anthony Summers is the bestselling author of nine works of nonfiction. His investigative books include Not in Your Lifetime, the critically acclaimed account of the assassination of John F. Kennedy; Official and Confidential: The Secret Life of J. Edgar Hoover; and The Eleventh Day, on the 9/11 attacks.<br><br>Donna Postel is fascinated by all kinds of stories and loves telling them. From memoir and biography to literary fiction, romance, mystery, and suspense, Donna uses her innate curiosity, talent, and decades of experience on stage and in the recording studio to bring books to life.Summers claims to have interviewed more than 600 people in the course of writing this book, and the effort shows in this exhaustiveand exhausting biography. Overall, the book is well written. Of the new material presented, the most provocative is Summers's assertion that Monroe's corpse was first discovered by Robert Kennedy and Peter Lawford. The reason for the confusion of facts about her death, says Summers, is that a coverup was conducted to hide Monroe's sexual involvement with both John and Robert Kennedy. Since Joe DiMaggio and Arthur Miller declined to be interviewed, this is not the definitive Monroe biography. Still, libraries that do not already have a surfeit of books on Monroe should find this a popular addition. Literary Guild and Doubleday Book Club featured alternates. John Smothers, Monmouth Cty.

Williams had devised an unusual guide to the hare's whereabouts: a multilayered riddle that he told in a fairy tale of his own imagining, and presented in dazzling, cryptic, paintings. <br><br>When the hare was finally unearthed by a British engineer, many were left wanting to know exactly how the clues worked out. In this paperback reprint of <i>Masquerade</i>, the author supplies an illustrated preface that pulls the strings, finds the goal, and points to what's important: the village chemist's daughter, the atomic weight of the elements, the shadows of the equinox, Henry VIII's first wife. Williams explains how numbers and colors correspond to the intricate ballet, and how the eyes really do see the answer. And of course, here are the magical pages that tell the tale of Jack the hare, and his journey to the sun. They are still there to discover, ponder, rediscover. And understand at last. <br><br>Suitable for ages 7 and up. 73,000 copies in print.</p><p>Kit Williams lives in a village in Gloucestershire, England.</p><h2>Little Bee: A Novel</h2><p>The lives of a sixteen-year-old Nigerian orphan and a well-off British woman collide in this page-turning #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestseller and book club favorite from Chris Cleave.<br><br>We don&#x2019;t want to tell you too much about this book. It is a truly special story and we don&#x2019;t want to spoil it. Nevertheless, you need to know something, so we will just say this: It is extremely funny, but the African beach scene is horrific. The story starts there, but the book doesn&#x2019;t. And it&#x2019;s what happens afterward that is most important. Once you have read it, you&#x2019;ll want to tell everyone about it.

The magic is in how it unfolds.</p><p><b>Amazon Best of the Month, February 2009</b>: The publishers of Chris Cleave's new novel "don't want to spoil" the story by revealing too much about it, and there's good reason not to tell too much about the plot's pivot point. All you should know going in to <i>Little Bee</i> is that what happens on the beach is brutal, and that it braids the fates of a 16-year-old Nigerian orphan (who calls herself Little Bee) and a well-off British couple--journalists trying to repair their strained marriage with a free holiday--who should have stayed behind their resort's walls. The tide of that event carries Little Bee back to their world, which she claims she couldn't explain to the girls from her village because they'd have no context for its abundance and calm. But she shows us the infinite rifts in a globalized world, where any distance can be crossed in a day--with the right papers--and "no one likes each other, but everyone likes U2." Where you have to give up the safety you'd assumed as your birthright if you decide to save the girl gazing at you through razor wire, left to the wolves of a failing state. --<i>Mari Malcolm</i>Chris Cleave is the author of <i>Everyone Brave is Forgiven</i>, <i>Gold, Incendiary</i>, and the #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestseller <i>Little Bee</i>.

He rose from poverty, taught himself to draw, became the promising pupil of a great master, and then defied tradition to become one of the most important and influential artists in the world.<br><br>Ray's paintings are rich with period and biographical detail. The endpapers show drawings from Hokusai's sketchbooks. Also included is one of his famous<i> Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji.</i><br></p><p><b>Deborah Kogan Ray</b> studied painting and printmaking at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. She is the author and illustrator of many books for children, including <i>I Have a Sister, My Sister Is Deaf</i> by Jeanne Whitehouse Peterson, a Coretta Scott King Honor Book. She lives in Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania. <br>The spirit of Hokusai, the Japanese artist best-known for his Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji, moves through the pages of Ray's (The Barn Owl) study with indefatigable energy. Born in 1760 and a rare peasant to rise to prominence during an era when Japan remained closed to the outside world, Hokusai outshone his masters and defied convention until his death at age 89. The painter, who never knew his father and whose mother died when he was just six years old, developed a quiet confidence and portrayed the peasantry from whence he came: " `I must paint the way my heart tells me,' he told wealthy patrons when they refused to buy his pictures of laboring artisans and humble farmers toiling in the fields." Ray's wash and colored-pencil illustrations depict Kabuki stages and fish markets that echo Hokusai's own sketches of everyday life (reproduced on the book's endpapers) yet her style remains her own. Instead of emulating the empty spaces and delicate brushwork characteristic of Japanese artwork, she drafts her figures with tangible weight and mass and clothes them in heavily shaded robes in deep blue, red and aqua. The text supplies plenty of historical background without undue complexity. Older children will be drawn to Hokusai's lively world, and adults will find inspiration in the man who wrote as he lay dying, "Even as a ghost/ I'll gaily tread/ the summer moors." Ages 7-up. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Good School</h2><p>At fifteen, Terry Flynn had the face of an angel and the body of a perfect athlete...Set in a small boarding school on the eve of America&#39;s entry into World War Two, &#34;A Good School&#34; tells the story of William Grove, the nervous teenager trying to fit in; the betrayed alcoholic, Jack Draper; and, Edith Stone, the teacher&#39;s daughter, who falls in love with the most popular boy in school.

It is the toughest ticket in sports, with black-market tickets selling for $10,000 and more. Success at Augusta National breeds legends, while failure can overshadow even the most brilliant of careers. As it is the only major golf tournament to return to the same site year after year, much of the fascination is historical. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>But as Curt Sampson, author of the bestselling <b>Hogan</b>, reveals in <b>The Masters</b>, a cold heart beats behind the warm antebellum fa�ade of this famous Augusta course. And that heart belongs to the man who killed himself on the grounds two decades ago. Club and tournament founder Clifford Roberts, a New York stockbroker, still seems to run the place from his grave. Roberts, an elusive and reclusive figure, pulled the strings that made the Masters the greatest golf tournament in the world. His story--including his relationships with presidents, power brokers, and every golf champion from Bobby Jones to Arnold Palmer to Jack Nicklaus--has never been told. Until now.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>No mere recitation of birdies, bogeys, and tourna-ment winners, <b>The Masters</b> is the intricate tale of the interplay among the town, the tournament, and the club. It is an amazing slice of history, taking us inside the presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower, Augusta's most famous member. It is a look at how the new South coexists with the old South: the relationships between blacks and whites, between Southerners and North-erners, between rich and poor. It is a portrait of a tournament unlike any other as well as the town in which it lives and breathes--with such characters as James Brown, the Godfather of Soul; the great boxer Beau Jack; and Frank Stranahan, the playboy golfer and the only white pro ever banned from the tournament.<br><br><b>The Masters</b> is a book that is certain to cause controversy yet will reinforce one's love for and dedication to the sport's greatest event. It is just as certain that The Masters will be the golf book of the year.</p><p>Curt Sampson follows his exceptional biography of Ben Hogan with another sweeping exploration of one of golf's icier hearts: Augusta National and the powers behind the Masters. A combination of history, sociology, and good old sports writing, <i>The Masters</i> counterpoints a rich, white institution with the town surrounding it that is anything but. Ultimately, the book tells the story of a singular sporting experience--and the marvelous drama it has provided--that manages to succeed spectacularly despite the arrogance, dourness, and manipulations of the homogenous bastion that deigns to let the rest of the world intrude upon its exclusiveness for one week every April.Praise for Hogan by Curt Sampson<br><br>"An exceptional book."<br>--Dan Jenkins<br><br>"Curt Sampson has dissected Ben Hogan and what he is about in further detail than anyone.

She has contributed to reference works and journals, and recently co-authored <i>Pocket Nature: Rocks and Minerals</i>. </p><p><b> Introduction </b></p><p> There are thousands of different decorative stones, and they are used in every country of the world. Look around and you'll see them adding color to the fronts of stores. They form the practical, hardwearing cladding to many architectural interiors and exteriors of company offices and public buildings. Enter a church, synagogue or mosque and you will see them, often in beautiful patterns, cladding walls and floors, lecterns and altars. Memorials are carved into them, graves are marked with them, and they make superb raw material for sculptors to carve. Beautiful, natural rocks have a functional place inside our homes too, forming practical surfaces for kitchens and bathrooms, or made into the vases, tealight holders and other ornaments so popular with contemporary interior designers. Of course decorative minerals are widely used in jewelry too. Stone has a timeless quality, and some of the most exquisite ornamental stones are found in the decoration of precious antique furniture. The tradition of using polished stone for decoration is shared among civilizations all over the world, going well back into antiquity. </p><p><b> Turning Rock into a Thing of Beauty </b></p><p> It has to be admitted that most natural rocks are not particularly attractive to look at. Even the stones in this book, when roughly hewn from the ground, are generally rather dull. It is when they are polished, buffed to a bright reflective luster, that colors are enriched and patterns and structures sharpened, and their inherent natural beauty s revealed. Not all rocks have decorative value. They must have a compact and cohesive structure that enables them to be sawn or shaped without splitting or breaking up, and they must have an attractive appearance. They also need to occur in nature in sufficient quantities. Some semiprecious minerals are so valuable that quite small deposits are commercially viable. For "dimension stone"-- that is slabbed and polished for architectural use -- much larger quantities of stone must be available. A huge global quarrying and processing industry supplies the polished stone we see all around us. </p><p><b> Detective work </b></p><p> Decorative rocks can reveal evidence of ancient life forms, and great global processes -- from earthquakes to the formation of great mountain chains. When identifying stones, it helps to understand a little about the geological processes that formed them and gave them their various characteristics. Traditionally, marble is defined as any rock composed of calcite or dolomite (two common carbonate minerals) that takes a good polish. The stone trade still uses this definition, comparing marbles to limestones that have similar compositions but do not take a polish. Modern geologists are much more specific: they classify limestones as sedimentary rocks, and marbles as limestones which have been "metamorphosed" that is, altered -- by heat and pressure. In a similar way, the trade uses the term granite to encompass a wide variety of rock types composed of silica or silicate minerals (but not as specifically as geologists in their definition). This "jungle of names" is explained more fully in the opening "All about decorative stones" section of this book, as are the "earth-shattering" processes by which rocks form, and the broad range of different rock types and how they are classified by the trade and by geologists. </p><p> This sourcebook describes and illustrates close to 300 decorative rocks and minerals, and introduces many others. This may be just a tiny proportion of the many different kinds used globally, but it includes those that are particularly popular or of special historic interest. The photographs show the stones in actual size, as they appear when polished. Each entry gives a short summary of the stone's source, history and use, and a brief geological description to help with identification. It will be an invaluable reference for archaeologist, architects, artists, antique restorers, auction houses, museum curators, the stone trade and geologists, and indeed for anyone who delights in the beautiful natural stones that are used to decorate the word around us. </p></p><h2>Rustic Furniture Workshop</h2><p>&#x201c;The perfect guide for anyone working with his hands.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Log Homes Illustrated</i>.

The adventures of Dorothy and her friends have enthralled generations of readers over the last century. Now, in Oz: The Hundredth Anniversary Celebration, thirty beloved children's book authors and artists pay tribute to the enchanted land that has done so much to nourish our imaginations, to make us laugh, and to inspire us. <p> In words and images, these great storytellers and illustrators pay homage to an American classic. From a joyous vision of skipping down the Yellow Brick Road alongside Toto...to moving memories of turning to Oz as a source of comfort during wartime...to warm tales of parents and children shoring the pleasure of discovering a magical world together, these reflections celebrate all that is most special about Oz. </p><p> Oz has proved to be an image of hope in the most difficult of circumstances, and the vivid words of L. Frank Baum have entranced even the most reluctant of young readers. Appropriately then, in addition to offering tributes to Dorothy, the Scarecrow, Tin Woodman, Cowardly Lion, and their friends, <em>Oz: The Hundredth Anniversary Celebration</em> honors reading itself Proceeds from the sale of this book will be donated to Reading Is Fundamental (RIF), which brings diverse literacy activities and free, new books to three and a half million children every year.</p></p><p>One hundred years ago, a little girl named Dorothy and her Kansas house were picked up by a tornado and whisked away to a land somewhere over the rainbow. This land was called Oz, and it has been the inspirational starting point for generations of children, writers, artists, and dreamers ever since. In this celebration of L. Frank Baum's extensive Oz series, thirty beloved picture book authors and illustrators pay homage to the wondrous Emerald City and its marvelous inhabitants. Brief personal essays are accompanied by remarkable illustrations by the likes of Peter S�s, Tomie dePaola, William Joyce, Kay Chorao, Jules Feiffer, Trina Schart Hyman, and Maurice Sendak. Robin McKinley was thrilled to find stories that featured "Girls Who Did Things." Ann M. Martin loved Frank Baum's poetic dedications in his books. Due to the fall of the Iron Curtain, Oz disappeared from young Peter S�s's life in Moravia for many years--eventually he discovered the communists had deemed it "ideologically incorrect." Madeleine L'Engle, Paul O. Zelinsky, Lloyd Alexander, Natalie Babbitt, and others describe their early encounters and later connections to Baum's imaginary world of tin men, flying monkeys, witches, and hen heroines. This collection of essays and illustrations is truly a labor of love--a perfect gift for any fan of Oz.

Finally, Wildsmith depicts Jesus' entry into Jerusalem, his death on the cross, and his resurrection and ascension.</p><p>Brian Wildsmith lives in the South of FranceAges 4-8. Wildsmith, who has written several Bible stories, now turns his attention to the story of Jesus. Using pieces from the four Gospels, he fashions a narrative that hits the high points of Jesus' life, including the nativity story, the flight to Egypt, Jesus' baptism, the wedding at Cana, the calling of the disciples, the raising of Lazarus, and Jesus' death and resurrection. Wildsmith's pictures are framed in windowlike arches, set against backgrounds of pure colors. As with his other works, gold embellishments add majesty. In places the text seems like a simple recitation of events, and some of the line work has a tentative feel. Still, this is an attractive offering, and libraries that own Wildsmith's <i>Exodus</i> (1999) and <i>Joseph </i>(1998) will probably want this as well. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

At an early age, he received a trumpet as a gift from his father. He practiced obsessively and eventually joined a California dance band. After graduating from high school, he ventured to New York City to study art under the tutelage of Joan Sloan and Harry Wickey at the Art Students' League. He managed to support himself throughout his schooling by playing his trumpet evenings, in nightclubs and at weddings.<br> <br> Gradually, he eased into making a living sketching impressions of Broadway shows for <i>The New York Times</i> and <i>The Herald Tribune</i>. This shift was helped along, in no small part, by a rather heartbreaking incident: he lost his trumpet. One evening, he was so engrossed in sketching people on the subway, he simply forgot it was sitting on the seat beside him. This new career turned out to be a near-perfect fit for Don, though, as he had always loved the theater.<br> <br> He was introduced to the world of children&#x2019;s literature when William Saroyan asked him to illustrate several books. Soon after, he began to write and illustrate his own books, a career he settled into comfortably and happily. Through his writing, he was able to create his own theater: "I love the flow of turning the pages, the suspense of what's next. Ideas just come at me and after me. It's all so natural. I work all the time, long into the night, and it's such a pleasure. I don't know when the time ends. I've never been happier in my life!"<br> <br> Don died in 1978, after a long and successful career. He created many beloved characters in his lifetime, perhaps the most beloved among them a stuffed, overall-wearing bear named Corduroy.<br> <br> Don Freeman was the author and illustrator of many popular books for children, including <i>Corduroy</i>, <i>A Pocket for Corduroy</i>, and the Caldecott Honor Book <i>Fly High, Fly Low</i>.</p><h2>Basic Microwaving, Revised Edition</h2><p>This is no ordinary recipe book.

These epic migra�tions have made and remade African American life.

He comes closer than any other contemporary historian to giving us an opportunity-in a single, readable volume-to come to grips with a subject very few of us wish to think about but which all of us surely need to consider: how millions of white Americans over the course of three centuries came to hold millions of black Americans in chattel bondage while managing to lose nary a moment's sleep over their complicity in this monstrous enterprise...Berlin has given us a moving, insightful account of slavery in the United States. Readers will not soon forget the story he has told, nor should they. We still live with the consequences of this institution, and we should understand what slavery meant to the generations of captivity who lived it."<br> -Charles B. Dew, <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br><br> "Berlin focuses on changes over time as it affected patterns of African American demography, family and community life, religious beliefs and practices, and labor in the field and workshop. In the process, he illuminates the rich complexity of slavery as it is shaped by various colonial powers (Spanish, French, British) in port cities and in rural areas...This compact volume offers an impressive overview of historic transformations and regional variations in the institution."<br> -Jacqueline Jones, <i>Washington Post</i><br><br> "Where <i>Generations of Captivity</i> differs from previous histories is in its emphatically bottom-up approach, looking at slavery almost exclusively from the point of view of the slaves themselves, and in its relentless emphasis on the institutions cruelty."<br> -Howard Temperley, <i>Times Literary Supplement</i><br><br> "Over the years Ira Berlin has established himself as one of the foremost scholars of North American slavery. His last book, <i>Many Thousands Gone</i> (1998), was concerned with the first two centuries of slavery in the United States. <i>Generations of Captivity</i> covers a lot of the same territory, but in doing so takes the story up to the American Civil War (1861-5) and beyond. The result is an absorbing work that demonstrates convincingly that slavery was not a static or monolithic structure but an evolving institution that changed dramatically between the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries...As one might expect, Berlin pieces together this complex history with great skill and authority. He rarely falters and, just as important, contrives to make the vast literature on North American slavery vital and accessible. <i>Generations of Captivity</i> is more than a work of synthesis, however. By incorporating the nineteenth century slave experience, not the wider history of Atlantic slavery, Berlin has added immeasurably to our understanding of the "peculiar institution", as well as our understanding of antebellum America."<br> -J.R.

Vivian Cash died in 2005.<b>INTRODUCTION</b> <p> </p><p> It was September 11, 2003, and although a beautiful day, there was an uneasiness in the air. My daughter Cindy had just arrived in town for a visit along with her husband, Eddie, and she felt it too -- an unmistakable sense of something amiss, something dreadful about to happen. So later that night when the phone rang at one thirty a.m., after we had all gone to bed, my heart froze. Phone calls in the middle of the night never bring good news. </p><p> And then a bone-chilling scream came from down the hall. Cindy was the first to hear the news: Johnny was dead. </p><p> For the rest of the night, none of us slept. Cindy was inconsolable, devastated, virtually drowning in grief after the call. She had spent the last three months with Johnny at his home, caring for him, doting on him, and she had just left for a quick visit to come see me. She was choked in grief now that she wasn't there when he passed. Helpless to do much else, I simply hugged her. </p><p> I knew firsthand the pain of losing a parent. I lost both of mine years ago. The coming weeks and months, even years, would be tough, not only for her but also for our other three daughters Johnny and I had together: Rosanne, Kathy, and Tara. Our poor babies would never be the same. I knew that much. </p><p> To the world, Johnny was revered as the Man in Black. But to us he was simply Daddy. To the girls, he was their world. And to me he is and will always be my wonderful, caring, protective husband and the father of my children. In disbelief I paced the floor. </p><p> Johnny was supposed to have been here in California, recording yet another record. He was to have visited New York for the MTV Music Awards on his way out, where he was excited to have been nominated in six categories. We were all excited. He and the producers of the show secretly planned for him to walk out onto the stage unassisted: Only recently his heath had been improving, and he was walking again. But as fate would have it, what was thought to be a troubling case of heartburn sent him to the hospital instead. That's where he stayed for two weeks before being released. Then this sudden disastrous turn for the worse. And now our lives were spinning out of control. </p><p> </p><blockquote> Within hours, Johnny's death was the top story on all the cable news channels and morning shows. The media frenzy had begun. CNN, Fox News, ABC, CBS, NBC, every channel I turned to, were all talking about our family. <p> The music world is mourning the death this morning of one of America's most influential performers, Johnny Cash... </p><p> Johnny Cash, the Man in Black, died this morning in a Nashville hospital at the age of seventy-one... </p><p> One of the greatest voices in American music is silent today... </p></blockquote> <p> It was surreal to hear them talking about Johnny in the past tense. Only eight weeks earlier, I had been with him in his home in Hendersonville, just north of Nashville, and we had enjoyed a wonderful visit. We sat and laughed about old times. We reminisced. We hugged and cried. We joked and teased each other. Looking back, that afternoon visit was a precious gift from God. My trip to Nashville had been a very last-minute decision, and I wasn't certain I would even have the chance to see Johnny. But I'm so thankful -- very, very thankful -- that God let us see each other one last time. </p><p> Ironically, it was during that visit that we discussed this book and I told him of my decision to write it. To be honest, I was a little nervous in telling him. I wasn't sure how he would react to me finally deciding to tell my story. Not only have I gone out of my way for years to not talk about our years together, but the real truth about our marriage and divorce has never been told. Now that I had decided to tell the truth, I wondered how he would feel about that. </p><p> My decision to write this book was a difficult one for me. Early on, I became aware that some of the things I planned on revealing would be upsetting to Johnny's second wife, June. I was also aware that some of her irritation might inevitably be targeted at Johnny. And with all of his medical problems at the time, I cringed at the possibility of imposing any additional misery on him. </p><p> Two months earlier, however, something happened that none of us expected: June passed away. It was a devastating blow to Johnny and to our girls, who had known June for many years by that time. However, along with the understandable sadness at her passing, I experienced a sense of liberation that I would be freer to say the things I have to say -- and Johnny would be freer to tell the truth too. The full story of our lives, the unvarnished truth, could now be told more easily without hesitancy. Would Johnny agree? I wouldn't know until I spoke with him. </p><p> During our visit, I settled in on a sofa by the fireplace in Johnny's bedroom and we chatted. It was so good to see him. He was enjoying improvement in his health in recent weeks. He had gone fishing for the first time in years. He had gone swimming. And he was walking again. On July 11 he took twenty-five steps unassisted. On July 12 he took seventy steps. It made me happy to hear of his continued improvement. And despite the fact that he was still obviously grieving the loss of June, I was thrilled to hear him say, "I'm happy." </p><p> One of the household help came into the bedroom with a silver tray carrying coffee and cream and sugar and set it on the coffee table. When she left, we finally had some privacy for me to share my news. </p><p> "Johnny," I said. As usual since the divorce, it was hard for me not to call him Honey. Years of habit are hard to break. I concentrated as I chose my words. "Johnny, I have thought long about -- and prayed about -- writing a book. I want to write a book and tell our story, and the truth of what happened. I spoke with the girls, and they are in support of it. So I've made a decision to do it," I said. "How do you feel about that?" I kept my eyes fixed on Johnny's face, watching for a change in his expression. </p><p> "I've been thinking about that for the past couple years," he said without a breath of hesitation. "I think it's a great idea." </p><p> "Are you serious?" I asked. It surprised me that he had been thinking about it for a couple years. I was floored. </p><p> "Honestly, I have been," he said. "Viv, I've been thinking for years, if anyone on this planet should write a book about me, it should be you. It's time." </p><p> As we discussed the book, Johnny became more excited. I could tell his mind was whirling a mile a minute. "If there's anything I can do to help, I'll do it. I'll write the foreword too. All my fans will buy it. I know they will. It's time." </p><p> <i>"It's time."</i> Was I really hearing him right? I was overjoyed! Those simple words, "It's time," took on so many dimensions. It was one thing to have his blessing, which I had hoped for. But to have his encouragement and active support was wonderful. I was so glad he thought it was time. </p><p> "I hope it will be healing for you too," he added. Ironically, I wished the same for him. </p><p> I also explained to Johnny that in telling our story, I might help other women who have gone through troubles such as we had. I so much want for good to come out of those darkest hours. </p><p> "Johnny, some of your fans might be upset hearing the details of our divorce and what happened," I said. I do worry deeply about the reaction the public will have. </p><p> But Johnny didn't waver in his support. "Like I said, all my fans will read it. They'll love it," he said with confidence. "It's time." </p><p> And in that single moment, having Johnny's support and blessing confirmed in my heart that it <i>was</i> finally time to tell my story. Too many things were lining up and falling into perfect place, clearing the way for me. I felt God guiding me forward each careful step of the way, assuring me I was on the right path. </p><p> The truth is, I have only recently begun to feel the grace and the reconciliation of making sense of what happened to our marriage. And now, with Johnny's blessing, I would finally have what I longed to have for so many years in his shadow: a voice of my own to tell the world the truth. </p><p> "Johnny, that makes me so happy I could just <i>kiss</i> you!" There was no hiding the tears welling up in my eyes. </p><p> I laughed as Johnny stared at me with outstretched arms. "Well, here I am!" We shared one of the sweetest hugs we ever shared. </p><p> It hurts my heart to know that afternoon was the last time I would see Johnny. If I had known, I wouldn't have been so quick to leave. I would have spent the rest of the afternoon with him. And I would have savored every minute. </p><p> I would have told him all the things I've wanted to tell him over the years but never did. I would have hugged him tighter. I would have told him how special he is, what a good man he is. </p><p> I would have held his hands and examined his face and searched for that young Johnny who stole my heart so many years ago. I would have relived so many more of the happy times with him. I would have asked questions that have lingered in my heart. I would have loved to hear him tell me what was in his heart too. </p><p> And maybe I would have told him my darkest secret, which I am only now able to admit. I would have told him that I never stopped loving him. Through all of it, despite everything, I never stopped loving him for one second. </p><p> Instead I just hugged him happily, said good-bye, and left thinking I would see him again soon. And now he's gone. </p><p> While word of Johnny's death spread around the globe, I sat quietly sipping coffee in our den at a window overlooking the Pacific Ocean. A world without Johnny hardly seemed possible. </p><p> In the hours that followed the horrible news, I did the only thing I could do, or have learned to do when times are bad: take each hour as it comes. As I managed through the next few days, my mind filled with memories of the life Johnny and I shared -- the adventures, the heartache, the success, the failures, the joy, the sadness, the secrets, the lies. And the regret. </p><p> </p><p> In the weeks that followed Johnny's passing, ...</p></p><h2>Lucifer Dethroned</h2><p>He was a Satanist...<br><br> His checks to the Church of Satan made that clear.

Based on a system developed in Tibet over thousands of years, this book is the first to bring the techniques to the West as a highly accessible and brilliantly effective package. Kum Nye consists of 8 positions to be held in sequence for up to 2 minutes. Each position is specifically designed to work on different areas of the body, while developing overall strength and flexibility. But, most importantly, these moves will increase energy levels, stamina and vitality. Such is their efficacy that they must not be done before going to sleep! But should be performed first thing as a truly invigorating morning wake up. Unlike any other kind of exercise system this can be mastered by anyone - regardless of age and fitness and, as a trained chiropodist, Wright lays emphasis on the benefits of this technique for people suffering from back pain and old injuries. Originally used to prepare Tibetan warriors for war, this ancient science is guaranteed to wake up even the sleepiest of sleepy heads.</p><p>In the best-selling tradition of Corvo&#39;s Zone TherapyStephanie Wright began working at the renowned Eden Medical Centre as a Chiropractor, where she now also teaches the Tibetan exercise system of Kum Nye. She lives in London.</p><h2>Press On!: Further Adventures in the Good Life</h2><p>An intriguing portrait of the life of a rugged individualist covers everything from flying stunts and tales of travel to fishing advice, family stories, and a live-for-the moment philosophy</p><p>In this informal, pleasantly rambling account written with Newsweek editor Leerhsen, the sound-barrier-busting air pioneer recalls hunting and fishing adventures, and talks interestingly about his passion for fixing machines and growing up in West Virginia. His wife Glennis, pal Bud Anderson, brother Hal and several other friends and admirers chime in now and then, filling in details the taciturn general leaves out. Anderson, for instance, thinks fun is Yeager's middle name, and offers examples of his aggressive pursuit of it in far-flung wildernesses. Hal remarks that his brother "will never be confused with Leo Buscaglia," and goes on to discuss the emotional self-control and stoicism that is a family tradition. The general himself comes across as a likable, uncomplicated guy with a wry sense of humor who has developed the ability to enjoy himself in mountainous boondocks into something of an art. As this memoir indicates, there is probably no better companion on a long-range backpacking trek into the Sierra. Yeager, uninterested in "this hero business," acknowledges that although Tom Wolfe is a nice fellow, "I've never understood a lot of what he was driving at" in The Right Stuff . The general much prefers reading Louis L'Amour. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.Carrying on in the style of Yeager , the General regales readers with entertaining tales of his post-military adventures, his home life, and, most of all, his love of the outdoors. In fact, this entry belongs more in the hunting and fishing section than in aviation history, since there are pages on mountain backpacking. The philosophy (expressed in the title) and personal makeup of that younger fighter pilot are still evident, however. The remainder of the book is a description of his daily life, coping with what he wryly calls "the hero business" and what he sees as his obligation to his public. Yeager never heard of "the right stuff" before Tom Wolfe coined the term, but if personal style and confidence are part of that "stuff," Yeager certainly has it. Mel D.

But under the victim's body the police find a Hellfire Club badge inscribed with the name Finlay Fitzjames--a name that instantly draws Superintendent Thomas Pitt into the case.<br><br>Finlay's father--immensely wealthy, powerful, and dangerous--refuses to consider the possibility that his son has been in Ada McKinley's bed. The implication is clear: Pitt is to arrest someone other than Finlay Fitzjames for Ada's demise.<br><br>But Thomas Pitt is not a man to be intimidated, and with the help of his quick-witted wife, Charlotte, and her well-connected friends, he stubbornly pursues his investigation--one that twists and turns like London's own ancient streets....<br><br>Anne Perry has devised the most intricate mystery of her prolific career in <b>PENTECOST ALLEY</b>, whose brilliant resolution will astonish and satisfy even the most discerning.</p><p><b>Anne Perry</b>&nbsp;is the bestselling author of two acclaimed series set in Victorian England: the Charlotte and Thomas Pitt novels, including&nbsp;<i>Death on Blackheath</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Midnight at Marble Arch,&nbsp;</i>and<i>&nbsp;</i>the William Monk novels, including&nbsp;<i>Blood on the Water&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Blind Justice</i>. She is also the author of a series of five World War I novels, as well as twelve holiday novels, most recently&nbsp;<i>A New York Christmas,</i>&nbsp;and a historical novel,&nbsp;<i>The Sheen on the Silk,</i>&nbsp;set in the Ottoman Empire. Anne Perry lives in Los Angeles and Scotland.Superintendent Thomas Pitt's rise to commander of the Bow Street station has carried him above the sordid run of London crime, but when Whitechapel prostitute Ada McKinley is tortured and strangled two years after the reign of Jack the Ripper, a cufflink and a button from the defunct Hellfire Club on the scene make the case sensitive enough to bring in Pitt. Both articles are traced to Finlay FitzJames, a young diplomat whose wealthy, ruthless father Augustus's massive contempt for Pitt and his mission casts his son in an even more suspicious light. Pitt, keenly aware of the pressure to arrest someone else, is relieved when his own wife Charlotte and her sister Emily Radley, insinuating themselves into the confidence of Finlay's sister Tallulah, uncover an alibi Finlay cannot make public--and even more relieved when he extracts a confession from a pimp that seems to close the case. A trial follows, as well as a speedy execution--and then, to Pitt's horror, there's a second murder exactly like the first, linked to Finlay by still another scrap of haberdashery. If Finlay is innocent, who is so determined to incriminate him? And if he's guilty, how can Pitt bring him to book when he's being ridiculed all over town for hanging the wrong man? Repetitious and yet perfunctory in probing the suspects; and bits of the truth, at least, are obvious from the beginning. Still, the mystification, and the intensity of Pitt's dilemma, are genuine. Altogether, Perry's best book since Defend and Betray (1992). (Book-of-the-Month Club main selection; author tour) -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Their bodies were never found and those familiar with the case have always been tortured by these questions: How do you kidnap <em>two girls</em>? Who&#x2014;or what&#x2014;could have lured the two sisters away from a busy mall on a Saturday afternoon without leaving behind a single clue or witness?</p><p>Now a clearly disoriented woman involved in a rush-hour hit-and-run claims to be the younger of the long-gone Bethany sisters. But her involuntary admission and subsequent attempt to stonewall investigators only deepens the mystery. Where has she been? Why has she waited so long to come forward? Could her abductor truly be a beloved Baltimore cop? There isn't a shred of evidence to support her story, and every lead she gives the police seems to be another dead end&#x2014;a dying, incoherent man, a razed house, a missing grave, and a family that disintegrated long ago, torn apart not only by the crime but by the fissures the tragedy revealed in what appeared to be the perfect household.</p><p>In a story that moves back and forth across the decades, there is only one person who dares to be skeptical of a woman who wants to claim the identity of one Bethany sister without revealing the fate of the other. Will he be able to discover the truth?</p></p><p><p>Since <strong>Laura Lippman's </strong>debut in 1997, she has been recognized as a distinctive voice in mystery fiction and named one of the "essential" crime writers of the last 100 years. Her books have won most of the major awards in her field and been translated into more than twenty languages. She&nbsp;lives in Baltimore and New Orleans with her family.</p>In Baltimore a young woman flees an accident and when she's apprehended, she stonewalls police about herself except to reveal that she is one of the Bethany sisters, who disappeared thirty years before. The young woman has a flat affect, and Linda Emond characterizes her tonelessly as she makes one evasion after another about the present while claiming decades of abuse and the adopting of multiple personalities to survive. Linda Emond's voice is neutral in filling in the aftermath of the abduction. She saves emotion for her depiction of the suspicious detective who reopens the cold case. Emond's characterization of this feisty, sexually charged man is edged with rough and passionate tones.

In those three books, Bakker created a world that was at once a triumph of the fantastic and an historical epic as real as any that came before. Widely praised by reviewers and a growing body of fans, Bakker has already established the reputation as one of the smartest writers in the fantasy genre-a writer in the line stretching from Homer to Peake to Tolkein. Now he returns to The Prince of Nothing with the long awaited The Judging Eye, the first book in an all-new series. Set twenty years after the end of The Thousandfold Thought, Bakker reintroduces us to a world that is at once familiar but also very different than the one readers thought they knew. Delving even further into his richly imagined universe of myth, violence, and sorcery, and fully remolding the fantasy genre to broaden the scope of intricacy and meaning, R. Scott Bakker has once again written a fantasy novel that defies all expectations and rewards the reader with an experience unlike any to be had in the canon of today&#39;s literature.</p><p><b>R.

It was, as you suspected, an account of the First Holy War as witnessed by the exiled Schoolman, Drusas Achamian. Verily, my hand trembles at the prospect of reproducing his vile and abhorrent claims, but as the original text has already been committed to the flames, I see no other way to satisfy your request. You are quite correct: Heresy is rarely singular in its essence or its effects. As with diseases, deviations must be studied, curatives prepared, lest they erupt in more virulent form.</i></p><p><i>For the sake of brevity, I will limit my review to those particulars that either directly or indirectly contradict Doctrine and Scripture. In this text, Drusas Achamian claims:</i></p><p><i>I) To have had sexual congress with our Holy Empress on the eve of the First Holy War&#x2019;s triumph over the heathen Fanim at Shimeh.</i></p><p><i>II) To have learned certain secrets regarding our Holy Aspect-Emperor, to whit: That He is not the incarnation of the God of Gods but rather a son of the D�nyain, a secret sect devoted to the mastery of all things, body and spirit. That He transcends us not as gods transcend men, but as adults transcend children. That His Zaudunyani interpretation of Inrithism is nothing more than a tool, a means for the manipulation of nations. That ignorance has rendered us His slaves.</i></p><p><i>(I admit to finding this most unnerving, for though I have always known that words and events, no matter how holy, always admit wicked interpretations, I have never before considered the way beliefs command our actions. For as this Achamian asks, if all men lay claim to righteousness, and they do, who is to say which man claims true?

A human horn.</p><p>For a moment all was quiet. Limbs arched across the imperious heights, and great trunks bullied the hollows beneath. Shorn saplings thatched the intervening spaces. A squirrel screeched warning from the gloom of interlocking branches. Starlings burst into the squinting sky.</p><p>They came, flickering across bands of sunlight and shadow.</p><p>Running with rutting fury, howling with rutting fury, through the lashing undergrowth, into the tabernacle deep. They swarmed over pitched slopes, kicking up leaves and humus. They parted about the trunks, chopping at the bark with rust-pitted blades. They sniffed the sky with slender noses. When they grimaced, their blank and beautiful faces were clenched like crumpled silk, becoming the expressions of ancient and inbred men.</p><p>Sranc. Bearing shields of lacquered human leather. Wearing corselets scaled with human fingernails and necklaces of human teeth.</p><p>The distant horn sounded again, and they paused, a vicious milling rabble. Words were barked among them. A number melted into the undergrowth, loping with the swiftness of wolves. The others jerked at their groins in anticipation. Blood. They could smell mannish blood.</p><p>Seed jetted black across the forest floor. They stamped it into the muck. They exulted in the stink of it.</p><p>The scouts returned, and at their jabbering the others shuddered and convulsed. It had been so long since they had last glutted their rapacious hunger. So long since they knelt at the altar of jerking limbs and mewling flesh. They could see the panicked faces. They could see the gushing blood, the knife-made orifices.</p><p>They ran, weeping for joy.</p><p>Cresting a low ridge, they found their prey hastening along the base of a back-broken cliff, trying to make their way to the far side of a gorge that opened as though by miracle several hundred paces away. The Sranc howled and chattered their teeth, raced in wild files down the slope, skidding across leaves, their legs kicking in long leaps. They hit the ground where it flattened, scrambling, running, burning hard in their rotten breeches, watching the soft Men turning mere paces before them, their faces as enticing as thighs, coming closer and closer, almost within the circle of wild-swinging swords&#x2014;</p><p>But the ground! The ground! Collapsing beneath them, like leaves thrown across sky!</p><p>Dozens of them were sucked shrieking into the black. The others clutched and jostled, tried to stop, only to be bumped screeching by their crazed kin. Their screams trailed as they plummeted into the concealed gorge, popped into silence one by one. Suddenly all was uncertain, all was threat. The war-party yammered in fear and frustration. None dared move. Eyes rolling, they stared in lust and apprehension ...</p><p>Men.</p><p>A hard-bitten handful, running as though by magic across the false forest floor. They lunged into the Sranc&#x2019;s midst, their heavy swords high and pitching. Shields cracked. Mouldered iron was bent and broken. Limbs and heads were thrown on arcs of glittering blood.</p><p>The Men roared and bellowed, hammered them to earth, hacked them to twitching ruin.</p><p>&#x201c;Scalper!&#x201d; the lone traveller cried out. His voice possessed the gravel of an old officer&#x2019;s bawl. It boomed through the gorge, easily audible over the white roar of water. As one, the men upriver stood and stared in his direction.</p><p><i>Just like animals</i>, he thought.</p><p>Indifferent to their gaze, he continued picking his way along the treacherous stones, sloshing through water every several steps. He passed a Sranc, white as a drowned fish, floating face down in a pool of translucent red.</p><p>The traveller glanced up to where the gorge walls pinched the sky into a wandering slot. Trees had been felled across the opening, forming the rafters for an improvised ceiling of saplings and sticks, covered over with leaves. The sky glared bright through numerous holes. Leaves still twittered down in a steady cascade. If the numbers of inert forms scattered and heaped about the rocks were any indication, it had been a very effective trap. In places, the river&#x2019;s foam spouted pink and violet.</p><p>Most of the men had returned to their work, but three continued to watch him warily. He had no doubt that the one he sought was among them.</p><p>The traveller tramped into their midst. The smell of burst entrails soured that of water and scoured stone. Most of the party sorted through the dead Sranc. Bodies were kicked off bodies. Broken heads were pulled from the water. Knives flashed. It was the same each time: pinch, saw, swipe, then on to the next one. Pinch, saw, swipe&#x2014;again and again. A flap of skin cut from the crown of every one.</p><p>Nearby, a young Galeoth swordsman washed a small hoard of scalps. He rinsed them, then laid them out, glistening and fatty white across dry stone. He handled each swatch with ludicrous care, the way a halfwit might handle gold&#x2014;which scalps had pretty much become in the High Middle-North. Though the Aspect-Emperor had lowered the Hallow Bounty, a scalp still fetched a full silver kellic from honest brokers.</p><p>They were all extremely conscious of his arrival, the traveller knew. They simply pretended to be indifferent. Usually, they encountered outsiders only when they trekked south to the brokers, flush with hundreds of tanned scalps, bound and dangling from lengths of leather string. This work, the work of collecting and counting, was the least manly portion of their trade. It was their menial secret.</p><p>It was also the point.</p><p>Nearly eleven years had passed since the Aspect-Emperor had declared his bounty on Sranc scalps, before the last of the Unification Wars had ended. He placed the bounty on Sranc because of their vast numbers. He placed the bounty on scalps because their hairlessness made them distinctive to Sranc. Men such as these, the traveller supposed, would be far happier poaching something less inclined to kill back&#x2014;like women and children.</p><p>So began the Scalping Years. Over that time, countless thousands had trudged into the northern wilderness, expedition after expedition, come to make their fortune as Scalpoi. Most died in a matter of weeks. But those who learned, who were wily and every bit as ruthless as their foe, prospered.</p><p>And some&#x2014;a few&#x2014;became legendary.</p><p>The man the traveller sought stood upon a rounded stone, watching the others work. He knew him from his dogged devotion to the traditional costume of his caste and race: the pleated war-skirt, stained grey and black and shot through with holes; the corselet with rusty scales stitched into rotting leather; the conical helm, bent back like a single ram&#x2019;s horn. He looked a wraith from another age. A second man, his face concealed by a black cowl, sat three paces behind him, leaning forward as though straining to hear something in the water&#x2019;s ambient rush. The traveller peered at him for a moment, as though trying to judge some peculiarity, then returned his gaze to the first man.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m looking for the Ainoni,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The one they call Ironsoul.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That would be me,&#x201d; the standing man replied. His face had been tattooed with the cosmetics favoured by his countrymen. Black lines about his eyes. Purpled lips. His look neither accused nor questioned but remained mild in the manner of bored assassins. Incurious.</p><p>&#x201c;Veteran,&#x201d; the traveller said, bowing his head in due respect. Failing to properly acknowledge and venerate a survivor of the First Holy War was no small offence.</p><p>&#x201c;How did you find us?&#x201d; the man asked in his native tongue. From the cadence of his voice, it was obvious that he despised speaking, that he was as jealous of his voice as he was of his women or his blood.</p><p>The traveller did not care. Men prized what they would.</p><p>&#x201c;We find everyone.&#x201d;</p><p>A barely perceptible nod. &#x201c;What do you want?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You, Scalper. We want you.&#x201d;</p><p>The Ainoni glanced back toward his cowled companion. No words were exchanged, only an inscrutable look.</p><p><i><b>Late Autumn, 19 New Imperial Year (4131 Year-of-the-Tusk), Momemn</b></i></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>Ever do Men seek to hide what is base and mean in their natures.

Now in this suspenseful new novel two investigations will lead Mayor's popular hero Joe Gunther to the shady realm of Internet chat rooms, where relationships are formed and broken, and nothing is as it seems.<br><br>News travels fast in the small state of Vermont. In this tight-knit society, police officers and investigators proudly maintain a kinship that transcends the boundaries of their jurisdictions. When an unidentified body is found in the peaceful town of Brattleboro, local police and the Vermont Bureau of Investigation both appear at the scene.<br><br>But before investigator Joe Gunther can begin to gather evidence of murder, a family emergency sends him to his hometown, where the lives of his mother and brother have suddenly been threatened. Gunther reaches out to a network of police officers who know him only by name and reputation as he attempts to discover the source of this imminent danger. <br><br>Meanwhile, his investigative team chases an elusive murderer who has no apparent ties to the victim. In a state that is more like a neighborhood community, secrets are difficult to keep, and it's sometimes impossible to know who can be trusted. Gunther soon finds himself opposing criminals more menacing than any he has ever encountered in order to save those he holds closest to his heart.</p><p>Archer Mayor lives in Newfane, Vermont. He writes full time and volunteers as a firefighter/EMT. He is also a death investigator for the state&#39;s medical examiner and a part-time police officer for the Bellows Falls Police Department. Mayor has lived all over the U.S., Canada, and Europe, and has been variously employed as a scholarly editor, a researcher for TIME-LIFE Books, a political advance man, a theater photographer, a newspaper writer/editor, and a medical illustrator. He won the New England Independent Booksellers Award for Best Fiction in 2004. He has also written short stories, two books on American history, and many articles. You can learn more about Mayor at www.archermayor.com.Relationships always drive Mayor's plots, but never more so than in this intricate, suspense-filled 18th Joe Gunther novel (after 2006's <i>The Second Mouse</i>). When Gunther's mother and brother are almost killed in a suspicious car accident, he helps Deputy Sheriff Rob Barrows narrow in on a local, lawless family with a grievance against the Gunthers. Meanwhile, the investigation of two similar but seemingly unrelated deaths leads Gunther's colleagues at the Vermont Bureau of Investigation to online chat rooms where older men pick up teen girls. Gunther's former lover, Gail Zigman, makes an appearance, but Lyn Silva, last seen in 2004's <i>The Surrogate Thief</i>, takes center stage as his new love interest. This book takes Gunther all over Vermont, offering occasional breaks from the tension with evocative descriptions of mountains and snow. Though Mayor is considered a regional writer, his books intelligently deal with subjects of national concern, and Gunther's crime-solving skills and personal charisma have broad appeal. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A great gust of icy wind from Lake Michigan howled at the windows.<br><br>"Merry," she whispered with longing. Rose resisted the urge to open the window and call out to her in the vast darkness. Merry's presence was palpable tonight. Rose had read somewhere that the spirit lingered for three days after death. Merry had been dead for four. Did she tarry to be sure her last request was honored?<br><br>Her last request. Why had she agreed to it? Rose asked herself, wringing her hands. The request was crazy, intrusive, maybe even hurtful. No one would ever go along with it. What would her sisters do when they read Merry's letter? Especially Jilly She'd never spoken of that time, not once in over twenty-five years. It was as though it had never happened. She'll be furious, Rose worried. But secrets in families always had a way of coming out in the end, didn't they?<br><br>The hall clock chimed the hour. Rose tilted her head, thinking to herself that she should be calling Merry for dinner now, telling her to wash up. A pang of loneliness howled through her like the wind outside. She wandered into Merry's lavender room, idly running her fingers along the girlish white dresser, the dainty vanity table and the silver-plated brush, comb and mirror set. Strawberry-blond hairs still clung to the bristles. Across the room, she bent to pick up the ratty red-haired baby doll lying in the center of the pristine four-poster bed. How Merry had loved the baby doll. Spring, she'd called it, and never once in twenty-six years slept without it. Rose brought the doll to her cheek, catching Merry's scent still lingering in the fabric. Then, with a loving pat, she placed the doll back on the bed, careful to prop it against the pillow. Rose's hands felt uncomfortably idle. She smoothed the wrinkles from the comforter with agitated strokes, then moved to the bedside stand to straighten the lace doily, adjust the pleated lampshade and line up the many small bottles of prescription drugs that she was so familiar with. She couldn't part with anything of Merry's yet, not even these medicines.<br><br>Without Merry to take care of, she felt so useless and detached in the old house, like the shell of a cicada clinging worthlessly to the bark. She needed work to keep her going, some focus to draw her attention from her mourning. With a discipline that was the backbone of her nature, Rose walked swiftly from the gloomy bedroom to the wide, curving staircase of the old Victorian that had been her home since she was born.<br><br>The walls along the stairs were covered with dozens of photographs of the Season sisters at various moments of glory and achievement in their lives. For comfort, she glanced at the familiar photographs, treasuring the faces captured in them: Jilly, Birdie, Rose and Merry. The Four Seasons, their father had called them. The largest numbers of photographs were of Jilly and Birdie, the eldest two. There were fewer pictures of Rose, and hardly any of Merry, the baby. She longed for her sisters; it had been nearly ten years since they had all been together. How sad that it took a funeral to bring them together again.<br><br>Who would arrive home first? she wondered. Birdie was extremely busy with her medical practice in Wisconsin, but Jilly had the farthest to come&#x2014;all the way from France.<br><br>Rose paused at a framed 1978 Paris <em>Vogue </em>magazine cover that showcased a young Jillian at twenty-one years of age, looking sex-kittenish in a fabulous pink gown that clashed in a chic way with her vibrant red hair. It was her first cover. Rose studied her eldest sister's full red lips pursed in an innocent pout, her deep-set eyes of emerald-green and the come-hither pose exposing one long, shimmering leg that seemed to go on forever. She couldn't imagine herself ever standing in front of so many people, in the glare of the lights, while men snapped her photograph. For that matter, Rose couldn't imagine ever looking so seductive or desirable.<br><br>Jilly was born at 12:01 a.m. on November 1, 1955. All Souls' Day. Mother always told of how she'd squeezed herself shut because she didn't want a child of hers born on Halloween. Who knew what nickname father would have chosen then? Their father, William, claimed it was a family tradition to play with their unusual last name. After all, he was nicknamed Bill Season. But their mother, Ann, a petite beauty with a will of iron, swore no child of hers was going to be tagged for life with a name people laughed at. As a compromise, Ann Season gave her daughters strong, sensible names, allowing their father full rein with the nicknames. Thus for his first daughter, Jillian, born in a Chicago autumn, he thought himself clever to name her "Jilly Season."<br><br>Moving down the stairs, Rose perused the large collection of photographs of Beatrice. Jilly liked to be first, but in most things Birdie came through for the prize. "The early bird catches the worm," their father used to say with a wink of pride at his second daughter. Birdie was his favorite, everyone knew that. Jilly would tease her and say Birdie was the son he never had. She was a tall, broad-shouldered girl with a powerful intellect and an even more powerful, competitive spirit. Even the name "Birdie" seemed to mock her tomboyish body.<br><br>Bill Season had chosen the nickname because she was born in early summer and was insatiable, howling for more food like a hungry bird in the nest. And she'd certainly caught the worms, Rose thought as her gaze wandered over the photographs. The first was Birdie at sixteen, beaming into the camera, dripping wet and clutching an enormous silver trophy for the state championship swimming team. She'd been the captain, of course. And there were more photographs, of Birdie as class valedictorian, of Birdie winning trophies for swimming, lacrosse and the science fair. Birdie receiving a diploma from medical school. Birdie dazzling in white lace and tulle smiling at her handsome groom, Dennis, the biggest trophy of all.<br><br>There were fewer pictures of herself, the third child. This section of wall seemed almost barren when compared to Birdie's. Rose felt the usual flush of embarrassment that the scarcity of photographs was an accurate&#x2014;if pitiful&#x2014;statement about her life. It was all very well that Jilly was a famous model, on magazine covers all over Europe, and that Birdie was a successful doctor, wife and mother. But what about her own life? There was neither a photograph of her graduating from college, nor a picture of a radiant Rose on her wedding day. Her mile-marker was a high school graduation photograph that showed a thin, shy girl looking much like she did today.<br><br>Rose's hair was a paler, washed-out version of the Season red that her father playfully called "pumpkin" and her mother optimistically called "strawberry blond." She still wore it in the same long, straight style of high school and her body was every bit as lean and shapeless as it been then. "Sticks," the other children had called her. In all the pictures, her eyes were the dominant feature. Enormous hazel eyes with brows and lashes so pale they were seemingly not there. They peered out from her pale face, large and wary, like a cat's when poised to leap away.<br><br>Rose was born in the dog days of August when her mother's roses were blooming. Thus she was called Rose, the only one of the four Season girls without a nickname. Rose was a fine, plain name, her father had always said. And it suited her, she thought with a sigh of resignation.<br><br>As with most families, the baby had the fewest photographs. Which was too bad, she thought, since Merry was arguably the most beautiful of all the Season girls. Their parents had been older when they married and had had children late. Thus, their father liked to say that Merry was his last hurrah. <em>The fourth Season. </em>Meredith was born in December, a season ripe with nickname potential, but Bill had settled on "Merry" because she was such a cheerful baby. Rose traced a finger across a picture of a precocious, impish Merry at two years of age. The pictures stopped then.<br><br>Rose turned her head away from the photographs, closing her mind from the memory, and wandered from room to room, feeling that edginess that comes when one is aimlessly looking for something to do. Each of the twelve rooms of the Victorian was immaculate, a savory dinner was waiting in the oven and flowers were beautifully arranged in the bedrooms. She turned on the television, then as quickly flicked it off again. She picked up a book and settled into a comfortable chair, but no sooner had she read a paragraph than her mind wandered again. She closed the book in defeat and laid her head back against the chair. With a heavy sigh, she reached into her apron pocket and pulled out a pale blue envelope.<br><br>Merry's letter.<br><br>She'd carried this letter in her pocket all day wondering whether to burn it or send it to the family lawyer. The moment of decision had come; the funeral was tomorrow. Rose closed her eyes and recalled how Merry's pink tongue had worked her lip as she'd struggled with the letter, wanting it to be her best. Merry couldn't have comprehended how those brief sentences, written in her childlike script, would send thundering repercussions in her sisters' minds and hearts&#x2014;as it had hers when she read them.<br><br>She looked down at the envelope in her hand and was moved to tears by the sight of the address painstakingly written in Merry's handwriting, encircled by a big heart: <em>ToJilly, Birdie and Rose.</em><br><br>She would give the letter to the lawyer, Rose decided. It was the right thing to do. Merry needed her&#x2014;trusted her&#x2014;to deliver it. This time she would not fail her.<br><br>Beatrice Season Connor looked up into the April sky and cursed.<br><br>"Look, it's snowing!" Hannah called, stepping out from the car. Her fifteen-year-old daughter's face turned upward, and with a delighted grin, she darted her tongue out to catch the soft, moist flakes as they tumbled gracefully from the sky.<br><br>"That's just what we need. A snowstorm on top of everything else."<br><br>"It's just a few flakes." Hannah's voice was full of reproach.<br><br>"From the looks of it, we're going to get a dump. Damn snow," Birdie muttered, grabbing the bags full of last-minute shopping items from the car and hoisting them into her strong arms. "I'm sick of snow. Hasn't Milwaukee had enough for one year? It's April, for crying out loud. Well, that's it," she said with the quick decision typical of her. Slamming the door, she headed toward the house. "We're going to have to hustle and leave for Evanston earlier than we'd planned if we expect to get everything done by the funeral." She stopped at the door and turned to face her daughter. "I'm counting on you, Hannah. I'm going to need your help."<br><br>"I don't see why <em>we </em>have to do everything." Hannah crossed her arms over her chest.<br><br>"We do if we want it done right." Birdie privately groaned at the prospect. The notion of pushing forward her departure when her schedule was already jammed full thrummed in her temples. She was squeaking out of town as it was. Sometimes she felt like a circus performer twirling countless plates: she had had to arrange coverage for her medical practice, calm her patients, take the dog to the kennel, cancel the housecleaning service, pack... The list went on and on. On top of all that, the funeral was tomorrow and it was up to her to make certain everything ran smoothly.<br><br>"When you need something done, ask a busy woman," she murmured with a heavy sigh, though secretly she felt a superior conceit. To her mind, all it took to succeed was discipline, setting goals and lots of hard work. And she worked harder than most. She could list her achievements readily: she was a pediatrician with a thriving practice, a wife for nineteen years, the mother of a healthy daughter and the mistress of a large, well-managed home. If there was such a thing as a supermom, Birdie thought with pride, then she was it.<br><br>But today was a test of her abilities. She lifted her wrist to check her watch and her lips tightened with annoyance. God, look at the time. Where was Dennis? And Hannah? Peering outside, she saw Hannah still leaning against the rear fender, gazing at the twirling flakes of snow. Frustration brought the pounding in her head to a painful pace.<br><br>"Didn't you hear me say we were leaving early?" she called from the back door.<br><br>Hannah's smile fell but she remained motionless, resolutely staring out.<br><br>"Don't pull that passive-aggressive act on me, young lady," she called, raising her voice as she walked nearer the car. She could feel her anger growing with each step. "I've asked you to get your packing done for twenty-four hours and so far you haven't done a thing. I'm not going to do it for you."<br><br>"Who's asking you to?" Hannah swung her head around. "You'd just pack the wrong things, anyway."<br><br>"This isn't a prom we're talking about. It's my sister's funeral. My baby sister! It's hard enough for me to deal with the fact that she's gone without having to argue about meaningless things like your dress."<br><br>"At least you have a sister."<br><br>Birdie felt the weight of that reply start to drag her under. How many years had she had this thrown in her face like a broken promise? "Hannah, please. We don't have time to argue. Just go upstairs and pack a black dress," she ground out with finality.<br><br>"You never ask me to do something, you order me. Yes, you do! I hate you!" she shouted when Birdie opened her mouth to object. Hannah fled into the house, slamming the door behind her.<br><br>Birdie knew that those words were spoken in the white-hot fire of teenage anger and flung at her to burn&#x2014;and burn they did. A mother never hears the words "I hate you" without cringing and feeling like a hopeless failure.<br><br>She followed Hannah back into the house with a heavy tread. Closed doors were a way of life between them now. Why did push always come to shove between them? And when had she started to feel the need to win these senseless battles? Not so long ago, she'd let trivial arguments slide by because all the parenting articles she'd read had a unified rallying cry: <em>choose your battles! </em>With teenagers, however, <em>everything </em>was a battle.<br><br></p><h2>Mauve: How One Man Invented a Color That Changed the World</h2><p>Offers a study of the color mauve--created in 1856 by eighteen-year-old English chemist William Perkin, who was working on a treatment for malaria in his home laboratory and accidentally discovered what became the most desired shade in fashion and ultimately led to the development of explosives, perfume, photography, and modern medicine.</p><p>In 1856, while trying to synthesize artificial quinine, 18-year-old chemistry student William Perkin instead produced a murky residue. Fifty years later, he described the event: he "was about to throw a certain residue away when I thought it might be interesting. The solution of it resulted in a strangely beautiful color." Perkin had stumbled across the world's first aniline dye, a color that became known as mauve.<p> "So what?" you might say. "A teenager invented a new color." As Simon Garfield admirably points out in <i>Mauve</i>, the color really <i>did</i> change the world. Before Perkin's discovery all the dyes and paints were colored by roots, leaves, insects, or, in the case of purple, mollusks. As a result, colors were inconsistent and unpredictably strong, often fading or washing out. Perkin found a dye that would always produce a uniform shade--and he pointed the way to other synthetic colors, thus revolutionizing the world of both dyemaking and fashion. Mauve became all the rage. Queen Victoria wore it to her daughter's wedding in 1858, and the highly influential Empress Eug�nie decided the color matched her eyes. Soon, the streets of London erupted in what one wag called the "mauve measles."</p><p> Mauve had a much wider impact as well. By finding a commercial use for his discovery--much to the dismay of his teacher, the great August Hofmann, who believed there needed to be a separation between "pure" and "applied" science--Perkin inspired others to follow in his footsteps: "Ten years after Perkin's discovery of mauve, organic chemistry was perceived as being exciting, profitable, and of great practical use." The influx of bright young men all hoping to earn their fortunes through industrial applications of chemistry later brought significant advances in the fields of medicine, perfume, photography, and even explosives. Through it all, Garfield tells his story in clever, witty prose, turning this odd little tale into a very entertaining read. <i>--Sunny Delaney</i></p>Simon Garfield is the author of several acclaimed books, including <i>The End of the Innocence: Britain in the Time of AIDS</i>, winner of the Somerset Maugham Award.

But David Wroblewski's extraordinary way with language in <i>The Story of Edgar Sawtelle</i> immerses readers in a living, breathing world that is both fantastic and utterly believable. In selecting for temperament and a special intelligence, Edgar's grandfather started a line of unusual dogs--the Sawtelles--and his sons carried on his work. But among human families, undesirable traits aren't so easily predicted, and clashes can erupt with tragic force. Edgar's tale takes you to the extremes of what humans must endure, and when you're finally released, you will come back to yourself feeling wiser, and flush with gratitude. And you will have remembered what magnificent alchemy a finely wrought novel can work. --<i>Mari Malcolm</i> <p></p><p></p><p> <strong>Book Description</strong> </p><p>Born mute, speaking only in sign, Edgar Sawtelle leads an idyllic life with his parents on their farm in remote northern Wisconsin. For generations, the Sawtelles have raised and trained a fictional breed of dog whose thoughtful companionship is epitomized by Almondine, Edgar's lifelong friend and ally. But with the unexpected return of Claude, Edgar's paternal uncle, turmoil consumes the Sawtelles' once peaceful home. When Edgar's father dies suddenly, Claude insinuates himself into the life of the farm--and into Edgar's mother's affections. </p> <p>Grief-stricken and bewildered, Edgar tries to prove Claude played a role in his father's death, but his plan backfires--spectacularly. Forced to flee into the vast wilderness lying beyond the farm, Edgar comes of age in the wild, fighting for his survival and that of the three yearling dogs who follow him. But his need to face his father's murderer and his devotion to the Sawtelle dogs turn Edgar ever homeward.</p> <p>David Wroblewski is a master storyteller, and his breathtaking scenes--the elemental north woods, the sweep of seasons, an iconic American barn, a fateful vision rendered in the falling rain--create a riveting family saga, a brilliant exploration of the limits of language, and a compulsively readable modern classic. </p> <p> <strong><i>Double Life, with Dogs</i>: An Amazon Exclusive Essay by David Wroblewski </strong> </p><p> We write the stories we wish we could read. There's no other reason to do it, to spend years pacing around your basement, mumbling, pecking at a keyboard, turning your back on a world that offers such a feast of delicious fruits. <i>The Story of Edgar Sawtelle</i> came about because some time ago I wished I could read a novel about a boy and his dog, one that integrated our contemporary knowledge of canine behavior, cognition, and origins with my experience of living with dogs; if possible, something flavored with the uncynical Midwestern sense of heart and purpose so familiar from my childhood (and something which, in truth, I've spent much my adult life being slightly ashamed of, as if either heart or purpose were embarrassing attributes for a grown-up to display). I'd recently come to know a good dog, maybe the best dog I'd ever met, and the subject of people and dogs and ethics and character suddenly seemed urgent. But when I went looking for such a story, I had to go back almost a hundred years, back to Jack London's <i>Call of the Wild</i>. That was a surprise. A little while after that, an idea for a story came to me--not the whole thing, but enough to start. </p> <p><b>Continue Reading <i>Double Life, With Dogs</i></b> </p><p> <strong>Praise from Stephen King</strong> </p><p> "I flat-out loved <i>The Story of Edgar Sawtelle</i>, and spent twelve happy evenings immersed in the world David Wroblewski has created. As I neared the end, I kept finding excuses to put the book aside for a little, not because I didn't like it, but because I liked it too much; I didn't want it to end. Dog-lovers in particular will find themselves riveted by this story, because the canine world has never been explored with such imagination and emotional resonance. Yet in the end, this isn't a novel about dogs or heartland America--although it is a deeply American work of literature. It's a novel about the human heart, and the mysteries that live there, understood but impossible to articulate. Yet in the person of Edgar Sawtelle, a mute boy who takes three of his dogs on a brave and dangerous odyssey, Wroblewski <i>does</i> articulate them, and splendidly. I closed the book with that regret readers feel only after experiencing the best stories: <i>It's over,</i> you think, <i>and I won't read another one this good for a long, long time.</i></p> <p>In truth, there's never been a book quite like <i>The Story of Edgar Sawtelle</i>. I thought of <i>Hamlet</i> when I was reading it, and <i>Watership Down</i>, and <i>The Night of the Hunter</i>, and <i>The Life of Pi</i>--but halfway through, I put all comparisons aside and let it just be itself.</p> <p>I'm pretty sure this book is going to be a bestseller, but unlike some, it deserves to be. It's also going to be the subject of a great many reading groups, and when the members take up <i>Edgar</i>, I think they will be apt to stick to the book and forget the neighborhood gossip.</p> <p>Wonderful, mysterious, long and satisfying: readers who pick up this novel are going to enter a richer world. I envy them the trip. I don't re-read many books, because life is too short.

He was the most profound Greek philosopher of the Christian era, a mystic and an incomparable poet whom St. Maximus designated as the &#34;Universal Doctor&#34; and the Second Council of Nicaea declared him &#34;Father of Fathers.&#34; Less prolific than Origen, less cultivated than Gregory Nazianzen, less practical than Basil, Gregory of Nyssa nonetheless outstrips them all in the profundity of his thought, for he knew better than anyone how to transpose ideas inwardly from the spiritual heritage of ancient Greece into a Christian mode.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>The Codex</h2><p>"Greetings from the dead," declares Maxwell Broadbent on the videotape he left behind after his mysterious disappearance.

An earlier solo novel, Jennie, was published by Tor Books and was turned into a television movie.<br>1&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Tom Broadbent turned the last corner of the winding drive and found his two brothers already waiting at the great iron gates of the Broadbent compound. Philip, irritated, was knocking the dottle out of his pipe on one of the gateposts while Vernon gave the buzzer a couple of vigorous presses. The house stood beyond them, silent and dark, rising from the top of the hill like some pasha&#x2019;s palace, its clerestories, chimneys, and towers gilded in the rich afternoon light of Santa Fe, New Mexico.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not like Father to be late,&#x201d; said Philip. He slipped the pipe between his white teeth and closed down on the stem with a little click. He gave the buzzer a stab of his own, checked his watch, shot his cuff. Philip looked pretty much the same, Tom thought: briar pipe, sardonic eye, cheeks well shaved and after-shaved, hair brushed straight back from a tall brow, gold watch winking at the wrist, dressed in gray worsted slacks and navy jacket. His English accent seemed to have gotten a shade plummier. Vernon, on the other hand, in his gaucho pants, sandals, long hair, and beard, looked uncannily like Jesus Christ.<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s playing another one of his games with us,&#x201d; said Vernon, giving the buzzer a few more jabs. The wind whispered through the pi�on trees, bringing with it a smell of warm resin and dust. The great house was silent.<br>The smell of Philip&#x2019;s expensive tobacco drifted on the air. He turned to Tom. &#x201c;And how are things, Tom, out there among the Indians?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Fine&#x201d;.<br>&#x201c;Glad to hear it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And with you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Terrific. Couldn&#x2019;t be better.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Vernon?&#x201d; Tom asked.<br>&#x201c;Everything&#x2019;s fine. Just great.&#x201d;<br>The conversation faltered, and they looked around at each other, and then away, embarrassed. Tom never had much to say to his brothers. A crow passed overhead, croaking. An uneasy silence settled on the group gathered at the gate. After a long moment Philip gave the buzzer a fresh series of jabs and scowled through the wrought iron, grasping the bars. &#x201c;His car&#x2019;s still in the garage. The buzzer must be broken.&#x201d; He drew in air. &#x201c;Halloo! Father! Halloo! Your devoted sons are here!&#x201d;<br>There was a creaking sound as the gate opened slightly under his weight.<br>&#x201c;The gate&#x2019;s unlocked,&#x201d; Philip said in surprise. &#x201c;He <i>never</i> leaves the gate unlocked.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s inside, waiting for us,&#x201d; said Vernon. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s all.&#x201d;<br>They put their shoulders to the heavy gate and swung it open on protesting hinges. Vernon and Philip went back to get their cars and park them inside, while Tom walked in. He came face-to-face with the house&#x2014;his childhood home. How many years since his last visit? Three? It filled him with odd and conflicting sensations, the adult coming back to the scene of his childhood. It was a Santa Fe compound in the grandest sense. The graveled driveway swept in a semicircle past a massive pair of seventeenth-century zaguan doors, spiked together from slabs of hand-hewn mesquite. The house itself was a low-slung adobe structure with curving walls, sculpted buttresses, vigas, latillas, nichos, portals, real chimney pots&#x2014;a work of sculptural art in itself. It was surrounded by cottonwood trees and an emerald lawn. Situated at the top of a hill, it had sweeping views of the mountains and high desert, the lights of town, and the summer thunderheads rearing over the Jemez Mountains. The house hadn&#x2019;t changed, but it felt different. Tom reflected that maybe it was he who was different.<br>One of the garage doors was open, and Tom saw his father&#x2019;s green Mercedes Gelaendewagen parked in the bay. The other two bays were shut. He heard his brother&#x2019;s cars come crunching around the driveway, stopping by the portal. The doors slammed, and they joined Tom in front of the house.<br>That was when a troubled feeling began to gather in the pit of Tom&#x2019;s stomach.<br>&#x201c;What are we waiting for?&#x201d; asked Philip, mounting the portal and striding up to the zaguan doors, giving the doorbell a firm series of depresses. Vernon and Tom followed.<br>There was nothing but silence.<br>Philip, always impatient, gave the bell a final stab. Tom could hear the deep chimes going off inside the house. It sounded like the first few bars of &#x201c;Mame,&#x201d; which, he thought, would be typical of Father&#x2019;s ironic sense of humor.<br>&#x201c;Halloo!&#x201d; Philip called through cupped hands.<br>Still nothing.<br>&#x201c;Do you think he&#x2019;s all right?&#x201d; Tom asked. The uneasy feeling was getting stronger.<br>&#x201c;Of course he&#x2019;s all right,&#x201d; said Philip crossly. &#x201c;This is just another one of his games.&#x201d; He pounded on the great Mexican door with a closed fist, booming and rattling it.<br>As Tom looked about, he saw that the yard had an unkempt look, the grass unmowed, new weeds sprouting in the tulip beds.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to take a look in a window,&#x201d; Tom said.<br>He forced his way through a hedge of trimmed chamisa, tiptoed through a flower bed, and peered in the living room window. Something was very wrong, but it took him a moment to realize just what. The room seemed normal: same leather sofas and wing chairs, same stone fireplace, same coffee table. But above the fireplace there had been a big painting&#x2014;he couldn&#x2019;t remember which one&#x2014;and now it was gone. He racked his brains. Was it the Braque or the Monet? Then he noticed that the Roman bronze statue of a boy that held court to the left of the fireplace was also gone. The bookshelves revealed holes where books had been taken out. The room had a disorderly look. Beyond the doorway to the hall he could see trash lying on the floor, some crumpled paper, a strip of bubble wrap, and a discarded roll of packing tape.<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s up, Doc?&#x201d; Philip&#x2019;s voice came floating around the corner.<br>&#x201c;You better have a look.&#x201d;<br>Philip picked his way through the bushes with his Ferragamo wingtips, a look of annoyance screwed into his face. Vernon followed.<br>Philip peeked through the window, and he gasped. &#x201c;The Lippi,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Over the sofa. The Lippi&#x2019;s gone! And the Braque over the fireplace! He&#x2019;s taken it all away! He&#x2019;s sold it!&#x201d;<br>Vernon spoke. &#x201c;Philip, don&#x2019;t get excited. He probably just packed the stuff up. Maybe he&#x2019;s moving. You&#x2019;ve been telling him for years this house was too big and isolated.&#x201d;<br>Philip&#x2019;s face relaxed abruptly. &#x201c;Yes. Of course.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That must be what this mysterious meeting&#x2019;s all about,&#x201d; Vernon said.<br>Philip nodded and mopped his brow with a silk handkerchief. &#x201c;I must be tired from the flight. Vernon, you&#x2019;re right. Of course they&#x2019;ve been packing. But what a mess they&#x2019;ve made of it. When Father sees this he&#x2019;s going to have a fit.&#x201d;<br>There was a silence as all three sons stood in the shrubbery looking at each other. Tom&#x2019;s own sense of unease had reached a high pitch. If their father was moving, it was a strange way to go about it.<br>Philip took the pipe out of his mouth. &#x201c;What say, do you think this is another one of his little challenges to us? Some little puzzle?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to break in,&#x201d; Tom said.<br>&#x201c;The alarm.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The hell with the alarm.&#x201d;<br>Tom went around to the back of the house, his brothers following. He climbed over a wall into a small enclosed garden with a fountain. There was a bedroom window at eye level. Tom wrestled a rock out of the raised flower-bed wall. He brought it to the window, positioned himself, and hefted it to his shoulder.<br>&#x201c;Are you really going to smash the window?&#x201d; said Philip. &#x201c;How sporting.&#x201d;<br>Tom heaved the rock, and it went crashing through the window. As the tinkling of glass subsided they all waited, listening.<br>Silence.<br>&#x201c;No alarm,&#x201d; said Philip.<br>Tom shook his head. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like this.&#x201d;<br>Philip stared through the broken window, and Tom could see a sudden thought blooming on his face. Philip cursed and in a flash had vaulted through the broken windowframe&#x2014;wingtips, pipe, and all.<br>Vernon looked at Tom. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s with him?&#x201d;<br>Without answering, Tom climbed through the window. Vernon followed.<br>The bedroom was like the rest of the house&#x2014;stripped of all art. It was a mess: dirty footprints on the carpet, trash, strips of packing tape, bubble wrap, and packing popcorn, along with nails and the sawed butt ends of lumber. Tom went to the hall. The view disclosed more bare walls where he remembered a Picasso, another Braque, and a pair of Mayan stelae. Gone, all gone.<br>With a rising feeling of panic he ventured down the hall, stopping at the archway to the living room. Philip was there, standing in the middle of the room, looking about, his face absolutely white. &#x201c;I told him again and again this would happen. He was so bloody careless, keeping all this stuff here. So damn bloody careless.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Vernon cried, alarmed. &#x201c;What is it, Philip? What&#x2019;s happened?&#x201d;<br>Philip said, his agonized voice barely above a whisper, &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been robbed!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2004 by Splendide Mendax, Inc.</p><h2>Word Biblical Commentary Vol. 12, 1 Kings (devries),352pp</h2><p><p>The Word Biblical Commentary delivers the best in biblical scholarship, from the leading scholars of our day who share a commitment to Scripture as divine revelation.

Malliet has crafted the English village of our dreams, with interesting small shops, a variety of inhabitants, and the local priest . . . who happens to be a former MI5 agent and also very handsome. Who wouldn&#x2019;t want to live in Nether Monkshood? Here&#x2019;s the fly in the ointment: people always die there, in the most unexpected and unpleasant ways. Though Max&#x2019;s personal life is a source of contention (Awena, his beloved, is a pagan), Max&#x2019;s ability to unravel a mystery is superb."&#x2015;Charlaine Harris, #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author</p><p>"It&#x2019;s great to see the return of Malliet&#x2019;s wit in a high-seas whodunit that deftly skewers the Hollywood high life."&#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews </i>on <i>Devil's Breath</i><br><i></i><br>"Charming... enjoyable... This is a cozy little addition to a cozy little series, a cozy little niche in the world of cozy corner mysteries." &#x2015;<i>Library Journal </i>on <i>Devil's Breath</i><br><i></i><br><i>"</i>With a cast of showy characters aboard, the who and why possibilities are ripe for entertainment... Malliet knows how to set a scene, and here she has lots of fun with the movie-world cast." &#x2015;<i>Booklist </i>on <i>Devil's Breath</i></p><p><i>"Devil&#x2019;s Breath</i>, like all of Malliet&#x2019;s novels, has clever plotting, entertaining characters, stylish settings, and a deliciously unorthodox view of the human condition.

Malliet has made a name for herself with her cozy-but-cutting English mysteries. A Demon Summer makes the case that she may be the best mystery author writing in English at the moment (along with French). She's certainly the most entertaining, with her delightful but surprisingly deep series about sleuthing vicar Max Tudor.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Cleveland Plain Dealer </i>on<i> A Demon Summer</i></p><p>&#x201c;With clever plotting that draws on classic elements of the British village mystery, characters conceived with care, an evocative setting and frequent doses of humor to leaven the inevitable sadness, Malliet continues her elegant and entertaining series, one that discerning fans of the genre will find stimulating, rewarding &#x2015; and a ton of fun.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Richmond Times-Dispatch</i> on <i>A Demon Summer</i></p><p>&#x201c;I'm a fan of G.M. Malliet, and <i>A Demon Summer</i> is more of a return to the roots of the series. Father Max Tudor, former MI5 operative turned Anglican priest, must visit Monkbury Abbey at the order of his bishop. A peer has been poisoned, though not fatally, by a fruitcake prepared by the Handmaids of St. Lucy, a contemplative order. Just when Max is concluding the poisoning was accidental, one of the visitors to the Abbey is done to death. Once again, Max must find the killer . . . this time so he can home to his handfasting to the pregnant Awena.&#x201d; &#x2015;Charlaine Harris on <i>A Demon Summer</i></p><p>&#x201c;Entertaining . . . the ending with a traditional gathering of the subjects will please Golden Age fans.&#x201d;&#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i> on<i> Demon Summer</i></p><p>&#x201c;The fourth fun entry in this charming English cozy series is delightful in tone.

G.M. Malliet&#x2019;s sly allusions to both Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot will make Christie fans chuckle, but Nether Monkslip is no village that time forgot&#x2015;not with its new age citizenry and a vicar who&#x2019;s a dishy ex-MI5. Highly recommended."&#x2015;Margaret Maron, Edgar, Anthony, Agatha winner, and author of <i>Christmas Mourning</i></p><p>"A contemporary and deliciously wicked homage to Agatha Christie's village mysteries, with an equally delicious hero who is infinitely sexier than Miss Marple.

If the first reports are to be believed, Joseph Ricardo died as he had lived. The distinction, if one can call it that, of being the last human whose birth was officially recorded, unrelated as it was to any personal virtue or talent, had always been difficult for him to handle. And now he is dead. The news was given to us here in Britain on the nine o&#x2019;clock programme of the State Radio Service and I heard it fortuitously. I had settled down to begin this diary of the last half of my life when I noticed the time and thought I might as well catch the headlines to the nine o&#x2019;clock bulletin. Ricardo&#x2019;s death was the last item mentioned, and then only briefly, a couple of sentences delivered without emphasis in the newscaster&#x2019;s carefully non-committal voice. But it seemed to me, hearing it, that it was a small additional justification for beginning the diary today; the first day of a new year and my fiftieth birthday. As a child I had always liked that distinction, despite the inconvenience of having it follow Christmas too quickly so that one present &#x2013; it never seemed notably superior to the one I would in any case have received &#x2013; had to do for both celebrations.<br><br>As I begin writing, the three events, the New Year, my fiftieth birthday, Ricardo&#x2019;s death, hardly justify sullying the first pages of this new loose-leaf notebook. But I shall continue, one small additional defence against personal accidie. If there is nothing to record, I shall record the nothingness and then if, and when, I reach old age &#x2013; as most of us can expect to, we have become experts at prolonging life &#x2013; I shall open one of my tins of hoarded matches and light my small personal bonfire of vanities. I have no intention of leaving the diary as a record of one man&#x2019;s last years. Even in my most egotistical moods I am not as self-deceiving as that. What possible interest can there be in the journal of Theodore Faron, Doctor of Philosophy, Fellow of Merton College in the University of Oxford, historian of the Victorian age, divorced, childless, solitary, whose only claim to notice is that he is cousin to Xan Lyppiatt, the dictator and Warden of England. No additional personal record is, in any case, necessary. All over the world nation states are preparing to store their testimony for the posterity which we can still occasionally convince ourselves may follow us, those creatures from another planet who may land on this green wilderness and ask what kind of sentient life once inhabited it. We are storing our books and manuscripts, the great paintings, the musical scores and instruments, the artefacts. The world&#x2019;s greatest libraries will in forty years&#x2019; time at most be darkened and sealed. The buildings, those that are still standing, will speak for themselves. The soft stone of Oxford is unlikely to survive more than a couple of centuries. Already the University is arguing about whether it is worth refacing the crumbling Sheldonian. But I like to think of those mythical creatures landing in St. Peter&#x2019;s Square and entering the great Basilica, silent and echoing under the centuries of dust. Will they realize that this was once the greatest of man&#x2019;s temples to one of his many gods? Will they be curious about his nature, this deity who was worshipped with such pomp and splendour, intrigued by the mystery of his symbol, at once so simple, the two crossed sticks, ubiquitous in nature, yet laden with gold, gloriously jewelled and adorned? Or will their values and their thought processes be so alien to ours that nothing of awe or wonder will be able to touch them? But despite the discovery &#x2013; in 1997 was it? &#x2013; of a planet which the astronomers told us could support life, few of us really believe that they will come. They must be there. It is surely unreasonable to credit that only one small star in the immensity of the universe is capable of developing and supporting intelligent life. But we shall not get to them and they will not come to us.<br><br>Twenty years ago, when the world was already half convinced that our species had lost for ever the power to reproduce, the search to find the last-known human birth became a universal obsession, elevated to a matter of national pride, an international contest as ultimately pointless as it was fierce and acrimonious. To qualify the birth had to be officially notified, the date and precise time recorded. This effectively excluded a high proportion of the human race where the day but not the hour was known, and it was accepted, but not emphasized, that the result could never be conclusive. Almost certainly in some remote jungle, in some primitive hut, the last human being had slipped largely unnoticed into an unregarding world. But after months of checking and re-checking, Joseph Ricardo, of mixed race, born illegitimately in a Buenos Aires hospital at two minutes past three Western time on 19 October 1995, had been officially recognized. Once the result was proclaimed, he was left to exploit his celebrity as best he could while the world, as if suddenly aware of the futility of the exercise, turned its attention elsewhere. And now he is dead and I doubt whether any country will be eager to drag the other candidates from oblivion.<br><br>We are outraged and demoralized less by the impending end of our species, less even by our inability to prevent it, than by our failure to discover the cause. Western science and Western medicine haven&#x2019;t prepared us for the magnitude and humiliation of this ultimate failure. There have been many diseases which have been difficult to diagnose or cure and one which almost depopulated two continents before it spent itself. But we have always in the end been able to explain why. We have given names to the viruses and germs which, even today, take possession of us, much to our chagrin since it seems a personal affront that they should still assail us, like old enemies who keep up the skirmish and bring down the occasional victim when their victory is assured. Western science has been our god. In the variety of its power it has preserved, comforted, healed, warmed, fed and entertained us and we have felt free to criticize and occasionally reject it as men have always rejected their gods, but in the knowledge that despite our apostasy, this deity, our creature and our slave, would still provide for us; the anaesthetic for the pain, the spare heart, the new lung, the antibiotic, the moving wheels and the moving pictures. The light will always come on when we press the switch and if it doesn&#x2019;t we can find out why. Science was never a subject I was at home with. I understood little of it at school and I understand little more now that I&#x2019;m fifty. Yet it has been my god too, even if its achievements are incomprehensible to me, and I share the universal disillusionment of those whose god has died. I can clearly remember the confident words of one biologist spoken when it had finally become apparent that nowhere in the whole world was there a pregnant woman: &#x201c;It may take us some time to discover the cause of this apparent universal infertility.&#x201d; We have had twenty-five years and we no longer even expect to succeed. Like a lecherous stud suddenly stricken with impotence, we are humiliated at the very heart of our faith in ourselves. For all our knowledge, our intelligence, our power, we can no longer do what the animals do without thought. No wonder we both worship and resent them.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>Lion of Hollywood: The Life and Legend of Louis B. Mayer</h2><p><i>Lion of Hollywood</i> is the definitive biography of Louis B. Mayer, the chief of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer -- MGM -- the biggest and most successful film studio of Hollywood's Golden Age. <p> An immigrant from tsarist Russia, Mayer began in the film business as an exhibitor but soon migrated to where the action and the power were -- Hollywood. Through sheer force of energy and foresight, he turned his own modest studio into MGM, where he became the most powerful man in Hollywood, bending the film business to his will. He made great films, including the fabulous MGM musicals, and he made great stars: Garbo, Gable, Garland, and dozens of others. Through the enormously successful Andy Hardy series, Mayer purveyed family values to America. At the same time, he used his influence to place a federal judge on the bench, pay off local officials, cover up his stars' indiscretions, and, on occasion, arrange marriages for gay stars. Mayer rose from his impoverished childhood to become at one time the highest-paid executive in America. </p><p> Despite his power and money, Mayer suffered some significant losses. He had two daughters: Irene, who married David O. Selznick, and Edie, who married producer William Goetz. He would eventually fall out with Edie and divorce his wife, Margaret, ending his life alienated from most of his family. His chief assistant, Irving Thalberg, was his closest business partner, but they quarreled frequently, and Thalberg's early death left Mayer without his most trusted associate. As Mayer grew older, his politics became increasingly reactionary, and he found himself politically isolated within Hollywood's small conservative community. </p><p> <i>Lion of Hollywood</i> is a three-dimensional biography of a figure often caricatured and vilified as the paragon of the studio system. Mayer could be arrogant and tyrannical, but under his leadership MGM made such unforgettable films as The Big Parade, Ninotchka, <i>The Wizard of Oz, Meet Me in St. Louis,</i> and <i>An American in Paris.</i> </p><p> Film historian Scott Eyman interviewed more than 150 people and researched some previously unavailable archives to write this major new biography of a man who defined an industry and an era.</p></p><p><b>Scott Eyman</b> is books editor of <i>The Palm Beach Post</i> and author of seven previous books about film, including&nbsp;<i>Lion of Hollywood: The Life and Legend of Louis B. Mayer</i> and&nbsp;<i>Print the Legend: The Life and Times of John Ford.</i><p></p><b>PROLOGUE</b><p></p><p></p><p>In the summer of 1944, when he looked out his window on the third floor of the Thalberg Building, Louis B. Mayer saw a studio -- his studio -- that covered 167 acres. Lot 1 encompassed seventy-two acres, housed all the thirty soundstages, office buildings, and dressing rooms, the seven warehouses crammed with furniture, props, and draperies. Lot 2 consisted of thirty-seven acres of permanent exterior sets, including the town of Carvel, home of the Hardy family, and the great Victorian street from <i>Meet Me in St. Louis.</i> Here was the house where David Copperfield lived, there the street where Marie Antoinette rolled to the guillotine.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Lots 3, 4, and 5 were used for outdoor settings -- the jungle and rivers that provided the backdrop for Tarzan, much of <i>Trader Horn,</i> the zoo that provided the animals, including the lion that heralded each and every Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film. Connecting everything was thirteen miles of paved road.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In periods of peak production, which was most of the time, the studio had six thousand employees and three entrances to accommodate them -- the gate between Corinthian columns on Washington Boulevard; another one farther down Ince Way; and a crew gate on Culver Boulevard, where the workers punched time clocks.</p><p></p><p></p><p>MGM owned forty cameras and sixty sound machines. Thirty-three actors were officially designated stars, seventy-two actors were considered featured players, and twenty-six directors were under contract. "Anywhere from sixteen to eighteen pictures were being shot at one time," remembered actress Ann Rutherford. "They were either shooting or preparing to shoot on every soundstage....You could stick your nose into any rehearsal hall or soundstage, and it was just teeming with life."</p><p></p><p></p><p>The studio had its own dentist, its own chiropractor, its own foundry. It made its own paint, its own rubber molds. There were shops where old cars could be fabricated and assembled; electric, glass, and plastic shops. If a prop could not be found in the vast warehouse, it could be made overnight, or purchased; the studio spent $1 million a year buying props.</p><p></p><p></p><p>About 2,700 people ate in the commissary every day, while the research department answered about five hundred questions daily. The studio's laboratory printed 150 million feet of release prints every year. Power was supplied by an in-house electrical plant, which was of sufficient size to light a town of 25,000.</p><p></p><p></p><p>MGM maintained a police force of fifty officers, with four captains, two plainclothesmen, an inspector, and a chief -- a force larger than that of Culver City itself. Each member of the MGM police was trained to recognize all contract players and to salute each star.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The MGM police had a slightly different mandate than most police forces. Part of their job was protecting the studio's assets from the public, but they also had to protect those assets from themselves. No matter what an MGM actor did, police chief Whitey Hendry had to beat the local police to the scene, where publicity chief Howard Strickling would make arrangements to keep the story out of the papers. To do this, the studio had paid informants in every local police department.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Twenty years earlier, when Mayer had moved onto what was then the Goldwyn lot, the studio had consisted of forty acres, five stages, six cameras, six stars, a half-dozen directors, and six hundred employees. In the intervening years, Louis B. Mayer and his lieutenants built a company that was regarded by the public and his peers alike as the pinnacle of the industry.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"It was <i>the</i> studio in this town," said screenwriter Bernard Gordon. "When I came out here in 1939, I drove by MGM and I thought to myself, 'By God, <i>that's</i> Hollywood.' No other studio compared, and Mayer was the boss. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. <i>Mayer!"</i></p><p></p><p></p><p>Each studio had its own specific ambience, and MGM's was a luxury that was a synonym for quality. The songwriter Harry Warren used to have a stock story about the difference between Metro and the competition: "At Warner Brothers, you come in the gate at seven in the morning. The guards on the walls keep their guns aimed at you. At 7:05, Hal Wallis calls out, 'Have you written that song yet?'</p><p></p><p></p><p>"At Metro, the birds sing. The grass is green. Everybody smokes a pipe and has the Book-of-the-Month under his arm. Nobody works at Metro. You watch the flowers grow."</p><p></p><p></p><p>For the audience, MGM was predominantly a means of escape. In the 1930s, MGM came to symbolize an alternate reality from the drabness and squalor of the worldwide Depression, an escape into a dreamworld of Park Avenue swells. During World War II, MGM movies were serving simultaneously as escape and rallying cry -- Mrs. Miniver rallied support for England and, by implication, the internationalist cause, while the home front was bolstered by <i>The Human Comedy</i> and Andy Hardy.</p><p></p><p></p><p>For audiences at home and abroad, MGM was Hollywood at its most Hollywood in the best sense of the word, proved by the fact that MGM grosses were reliably leagues ahead of its competitors' and had been since the company was formed in 1924.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The year before, in 1943, MGM had released thirty-five pictures, among them <i>The Human Comedy, DuBarry Was a Lady, Girl Crazy, A Guy Named Joe, Bataan, Lassie Come Home,</i> and a full roster of programmers. In 1944, Mayer was riding herd on a group of pictures that included <i>Meet Me in St. Louis, Gaslight, National Velvet, Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo,</i> and <i>The White Cliffs of Dover.</i> Although there was a war on -- actually, because there was a war on -- profits for the MGM division of Loew's, Inc. for 1944-45 (the financial year ran June to July) would be an astonishing $22.4 million on a gross of $98.1 million, compared to $14.5 million in profits for Paramount, $10.9 million for Fox, $3.4 million for Universal.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Within the industry, when Paramount or RKO made a particularly good picture, it would be said that "it was of MGM quality"; at a sneak preview, when the MGM logo of a roaring lion appeared, there would be a spontaneous burst of applause from the audience.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Singer Tony Martin asserted that "Being...at MGM was the movie equivalent of being a pitcher on the New York Yankees -- you were first-class, everybody knew you were first-class and there was no reason not to be grateful for having the privilege."</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Warner Brothers had its stock company, sure," said Ann Rutherford, "but who wanted to rub elbows with Guy Kibbee and Hugh Herbert, bless their hearts?...Most of the contract people at MGM stayed and stayed and stayed. Why? Because the studio looked after them. Warner Brothers wouldn't -- they were always spanking somebody or selling them down the river. From the time you were signed at MGM you just felt you were in God's hands."</p><p></p><p></p><p>"It was almost feudal in the way it was so self-contained," remembered actress Janet Leigh. "Everything was grown inside. It was a complete city. There were doctors and dentists, there were people to teach you acting and singing and dancing. There were people to help you with your finances. You could live there. And the people were like family, because everybody was under contract, not just the actors and producers, but the electricians. If I finished one picture, I might find a different crew on the next one, but the one after that would probably have the same crew from the first picture. You had a sense of being surrounded by friendly, familiar faces; you had great continuity."</p><p></p><p></p><p>"MGM functioned like General Motors," remembered actor Ricardo Montalban. "It was run with such efficiency that it was a marvel. It was done by teamwork; they could project the product, and the product was not any individual movie, it was the actor. They created a persona that they thought the public would like; they tailor-made the publicity to create a persona throughout the world. It was amazing."</p><p></p><p></p><p>The key to the smooth running of this machine was detail, a sense of the overall that kept employees functioning whether they were working on a picture or not. An actor who wasn't assigned to a picture was still expected to be exercising, attending acting, dance, music, or speech classes, working in screen tests with prospective talent, promoting the studio's releases, or slipping into a tux to fill an empty chair at a studio dinner.</p><p></p><p></p><p>And none of this vast, smooth-running organization mattered as much as it ordinarily would have that summer of 1944. Louis B. Mayer, sitting in his office with white leather walls, a custom-designed wraparound desk, and an adjoining soundproof telephone room where he could consult with New York a half-dozen times a day, had a serious problem: He believed that his most popular young leading man was homosexual.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>The Shockwave Rider</h2><p>A Science Fiction Book Club Selection<br><br>"When John Brunner first told me of his intention to write this book, I was fascinated -- but I wondered whether he, or anyone, could bring it off.

Now, in this enthralling new book, he tells the story of objects that are, to many, the pinnacle of the jeweler&#x2019;s art: the Faberg� imperial eggs.<br><br>The Easter presents that Russia&#x2019;s last two czars gave to their czarinas have become synonymous with privilege, beauty, and an almost provocative uselessness. They are perhaps the most redolent symbols of the old empire&#x2019;s phenomenal craftsmanship, of the decadence of its court, and of the upheavals that brought about its inevitable downfall. <i>Faberg�&#x2019;s Eggs</i> is the first book to recount the remarkable story of these masterpieces, taking us from the circumstances that inspired each egg&#x2019;s design, through their disappearance in the trauma of revolution, to their eventual reemergence in the global marketplace.<br><br>In 1885, Carl Faberg� created a seemingly plain white egg for Czar Alexander III to give to his beloved wife, Marie Fedorovna. It was the surprises hidden inside that made it special: a diamond miniature of the Imperial crown and a ruby pendant. This gift began a tradition that would last for more than three decades: lavishly extravagant eggs commemorating public events that, in retrospect, seem little more than staging posts on the march to revolution. Above all, the eggs illustrate the attitudes that would ultimately lead to the downfall of the Romanovs: their apparent indifference to the poverty that choked their country, their preference for style over substance, and, during the reign of Nicholas II, their all-consuming concern with the health of the czarevitch Alexis, the sickly heir to the throne&#x2013;a preoccupation that would propel them toward Rasputin and the doom of the dynasty. <br><br>More than a superb new account of a classic tragedy, <i>Faberg�&#x2019;s Eggs </i>illuminates some fascinating aspects of twentieth-century history. The eggs&#x2019; amazing journey from revolutionary Russia features a cast of characters including embattled Bolsheviks, acquisitive British royals, eccentric artifact salesmen, and such famous business and society figures as Arm and Hammer, Marjorie Merriweather Post, and Malcolm Forbes. Finally, Toby Faber tantalizingly suggests that some of the eggs long thought lost may eventually emerge.<br><br>Darting from the palaces of a besieged Russia to the showcases of New York&#x2019;s modern mega-wealthy, <i>Faberg�&#x2019;s Eggs</i> weaves a story unparalleled in its drama and extravagance. <br><br><b>Praise for <i>Stradivari&#x2019;s Genius</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Fascinating . . . lively . . . more enthralling, earthy and illuminating than any fiction could be.&#x201d;<br><i>&#x2013;The New York Times Book Review</i><br><i><br></i>&#x201c;A celebration of six instruments and the master craftsman who made them . . .

The long fast of Lent would have been strictly observed&#x2014;no meat, milk, butter, or eggs for more than seven weeks&#x2014;until the solemn celebrations of Holy Week built steadily to their joyful climax at a midnight service finishing early on Easter morning. Throughout the day itself, friends and family greeted each other with the traditional three kisses, and responded to the jubilant &#x201c;Christ is risen!&#x201d; with a reply of equal certainty: &#x201c;He is risen indeed!&#x201d; And then, in a ritual whose symbolism stretches back to pagan spring festivals, they would exchange eggs. <br><br>So Czar Alexander III was simply following tradition when, in 1885, he gave his beloved czarina, the popular Marie Fedorovna, an apparently unexciting white enameled egg. About two and a half inches high, it had the size and appearance of a large duck egg, but with a gold band around its middle. Only when the empress opened the czar&#x2019;s present did it reveal its true nature: like an elaborate matryoshka doll it contained a perfect yolk, made of gold; within that was a golden hen, sitting on a nest of golden straw; and inside the hen was a diamond miniature of the imperial crown, concealing a tiny ruby pendant. Every detail was exquisitely rendered&#x2014;the craftsmanship unparalleled, the creativity inspired. It was the first egg made by Carl Faberg� for the Russian court.<br>Faberg� was not even forty when his firm made that first egg for the czar, but his family had, in a sense, spent more than a lifetime preparing for this moment. Not only was his father, Gustav, a jeweler, but it is safe to assume that his more distant ancestors were craftsmen, too. Their surnames alone give that away: Favry, Fabri, and Fabrier all appear to have been used at some point, and all, like Faberg� itself, are derived from the Latin word &#x201c;faber,&#x201d; meaning &#x201c;smith&#x201d; or &#x201c;maker.&#x201d; In the eighteenth century these ancestors were living in France, but their Protestant religion marked them out for persecution by another absolute monarch, the Roman Catholic Louis XIV (1638&#x2013;1715). At least two hundred thousand Huguenots&#x2014;many of them skilled artisans&#x2014;fled France following Louis&#x2019;s repeal in 1685 of the Edict of Nantes, which had until then guaranteed religious toleration. Carl&#x2019;s ancestors were among them, and chose to go east. <br><br>By 1800, Peter Favry had settled in P�rnu, in current-day Estonia, where he had taken Russian citizenship, a move that gave his family freedom from further religious intolerance. Gustav was born here in 1814, and by 1820 his surname was already Faberge. He seems to have added the accent to the final e in 1842. The gradual name change smacks of an attempt at social betterment. The aristocracy of nineteenth-century Russia still spoke in French and looked to Paris as the fount of culture. It would have done the former Favrys no harm to stress their Gallic origins. <br><br>Gustav&#x2019;s ambition is evidenced by his early move to Russia&#x2019;s capital, Saint Petersburg. Here he trained with some of Russia&#x2019;s most eminent jewelers, including I. V. Keibel, the firm that only a few years earlier had reset the crown jewels for Czar Nicholas I. Soon enough, Gustav was ready to set up on his own as a master goldsmith, and in 1841 he opened his own shop&#x2014;only a basement, but located on the Bolshaya Morskaya, one of the smartest streets in Saint Petersburg. <br><br>Five years later, on May 5, 1846, Gustav&#x2019;s son, Carl Gustavovitch Faberg�, was born. He would become the vehicle for his father&#x2019;s dreams, not only attending one of the most fashionable schools in Saint Petersburg but also spending long hours in the workshop. Here he started to learn the basics of jewelry making from his father&#x2019;s senior employee, the Finnish workmaster Hiskias Pendin. <br><br>Then, in 1860, when he was only forty-six, Gustav Faberg� retired. Leaving Pendin and a manager in charge of the business, he took his family to Dresden, the capital of Saxony, back in Germany. It seems a bizarre decision. Gustav was not, apparently, ill; he lived for another thirty years. It may be that he could no longer stand the marshy atmosphere of Saint Petersburg&#x2014;the houses sealed tight against the cold of winter, the quagmires of spring, and the baking heat of summer. Or it may be that he had become aware of his son&#x2019;s talent, and realized that for it to flower Carl would need to be educated in a manner that Russian schools simply could not provide. If Gustav was to remain in at least nominal contact with his business in Saint Petersburg, there was no better place for his son to expand his horizons and develop his skills than Dresden, &#x201c;the Florence of the Elbe.&#x201d; <br><br>Certainly, Carl&#x2019;s education from 1860 bears the hallmarks of a carefully plotted trajectory. It began at Dresden&#x2019;s handelsschule, literally, &#x201c;trade school.&#x201d; This was where the sons of Saxon merchants went to learn the rudiments of business administration. A subsequent grand tour gave Carl the opportunity to visit jewelers in England, Italy, and, above all, Paris, where newcomers such as Cartier and Boucheron were turning out designs that married traditional craftsmanship with creative flair. In Paris, too, Carl spent more time in a commercial college. Finally, he took up an apprenticeship with a goldsmith in Frankfurt, but it was only a short attachment, one that gave him the opportunity to see a master at work, not to perfect every technique. In short, Carl seems to have spent his years outside Russia in pursuit of two main aims: exposure to Western culture and preparation for a life in business. The son of Gustav Faberg� was destined to be the head of a firm&#x2014;an employer, not an employee. <br><br>In 1864, four years after his father had taken him to Dresden, Carl Faberg� returned to work for the family firm in Saint Petersburg. He was only eighteen; his education continued. Partly this involved learning at the side of Hiskias Pendin, but Carl also did his best to seek out the works of earlier, more European, master jewelers. He found them in the Hermitage, the great museum attached to Saint Petersburg&#x2019;s Winter Palace. Here, treasures accumulated by previous generations of czars had been on display to the public since the 1850s. Carl developed friendships with members of the Hermitage directorate, and in 1867 began unpaid work there. The museum had started to receive items of ancient jewelry discovered during archaeological investigations; they needed someone to repair them and assess their materials. Carl volunteered. <br><br>By 1872, when he was twenty-six, Carl Faberg� was ready both to take over his father&#x2019;s business and to marry. His wife was also his cousin, Augusta Jacobs, the daughter of a cabinetmaker. Three sons followed in quick succession, born between 1874 and 1877: Eug�ne, Agathon, and Alexander. A fourth son, Nicholas, died at age two in 1883; and a fifth and last son, again called Nicholas, was born the following year. Later employees of Carl Faberg� would tell of the jeweler welcoming his customers&#x2019; children, setting out animals carved from semiprecious stones for them to play with, unconcerned with the fragility of a chosen toy. These descriptions suggest a kindly and interested father, and his sons all eventually chose to join him in the company. Nevertheless, whatever the distractions of family life, Carl remained focused on the business entrusted to him by his own father. He moved it to larger premises, still on Bolshaya Morskaya, and began the changes that would transform what his eldest son, Eug�ne, later called &#x201c;a dealer in petty jewelry and spectacles&#x201d; into the premier jeweler in Europe. <br><br>Faberg�&#x2019;s time in Europe and the Hermitage had inspired him; he wanted to make pieces of jewelry that were more than the sum of their parts&#x2014;to elevate design and craftsmanship above mere materials. In his own words, much later, &#x201c;Expensive things interest me little if the value is merely in so many diamonds or pearls.&#x201d; In nineteenth-century Russia this was a groundbreaking philosophy. Everyone knew the story of how Count Orlov had secured his position at Catherine the Great&#x2019;s court with the gift to her of a single massive diamond, smuggled from India. The purchase had bankrupted him, but favors from a grateful empress soon proved it had been a wise investment. Little had changed in the century since Catherine&#x2019;s death. According to an English diplomat, Lord Frederic Hamilton, who spent much of the 1880s in Saint Petersburg, &#x201c;A stone must be very perfect to satisfy the critical Russian eye, and, true to their Oriental blood, the ladies preferred unfaceted rubies, sapphires, and emeralds.&#x201d; One of Carl Faberg�&#x2019;s great achievements was that he not only made beautifully designed jewelry, but succeeded in selling it to the Russian aristocracy. He changed the taste of Saint Petersburg. <br><br>Very few pieces of Faberg� survive from these early years, so it is hard to trace the development of Carl&#x2019;s ideas, or of his skills as a designer. By 1881, however, he had achieved enough recognition among his peers to be appointed a &#x201c;master&#x201d; of the second guild. In keeping with the commercial flavor of his education, the title marked him as a merchant or retailer rather than a craftsman. It allowed him to use his own hallmark confirming precious metal content without submitting his pieces for official testing. Presumably it is no coincidence that this was the year that Hiskias Pendin died. The firm might still be called &#x201c;Gustav Faberg�,&#x201d; but its owner remained in Dresden. Carl was now formally acknowledged, by all, as its head. <br><br>The business was already reasonably substantial, employing about twenty people, but it was the following year, 1882, that brought Faberg� his first major breakthrough&#x2014;the attention of the imperial family. The occasion was an exhibition in Moscow of artifacts from all over Russia. Faberg� had been invited to participate because of his work at the Hermitage Museum. The articles he had helped to restore included Greek and Scythian jewelry dating back to the fourth century b.c., which had been found at Kerch, on the Black Sea coast. Faberg� had obtained permission both to copy them and to incorporate their designs in more modern objects; he made the results the focus of his display at the exhibition. It was an inspired decision; Faberg� could show off creativity then unexpected in a jeweler, while rooting it in a tradition so ancient that no Russian could fail to be impressed. A notice in the magazine Niva was suitably ecstatic: &#x201c;Mr. Faberg� opens a new era in the art of jewelry. We wish him all the best in his efforts to bring back into the realm of art what once used to be a part of it.&#x201d; The same article carried a final, telling paragraph: &#x201c;Her Majesty honored Faberg� by buying a pair of cuff links with images of cicadas, which, according to Ancient Greek belief, bring luck.&#x201d; <br><br>A decade after taking over his father&#x2019;s business Carl Faberg� had achieved royal recognition. Nevertheless, he was only one jeweler among many supplying the Russian court; at least five firms feature in the imperial accounts for the following year, 1883, and the amount paid to Faberg�&#x2014;just under 6,400 rubles ($3,100/$64,000*)&#x2014;was by far the smallest. The next year his friends at the Hermitage tried to get him an imperial warrant, the formal acknowledgment of his position as a royal supplier, and a hugely valuable affirmation of status in a capital city where life still revolved around the court. The request was refused; that sort of honor was not given lightly. <br><br>Only one year later, however, in 1885, the czar gave his wife, Marie Fedorovna, her first Easter present from Faberg�&#x2014;the Hen Egg. He had given her jeweled eggs on previous Easters; he cannot have known that this gift would be the first of a series that would eventually span more than three decades. Nor was the cost of this first egg&#x2014;4,151 rubles ($2,000/$43,000)&#x2014;such that the decision to order it needed very much thought. It represented a tiny fraction of the czar&#x2019;s annual&nbsp; income&#x2014;an estimated nine million rubles ($4.4 million/$94 million). Faberg� may simply have been chosen for the commission because it was his &#x201c;turn.&#x201d; Nevertheless, there is evidence that this year, at least, the czar wanted an egg that was designed to be more than just a collection of precious stones. It comes from a pair of letters, now in the Russian State Historical Archives, exchanged between the czar and his brother, the grand duke Vladimir. <br><br>The first letter is from the grand duke. Sent on March 21, 1885, three days before Easter, it clearly accompanied the egg, which Vladimir must have picked up from Faberg� on his brother&#x2019;s behalf. The note contains detailed instructions on how to open each successive layer within the egg, and gives his opinion of it as &#x201c;a complete success . . . praiseworthy for its fine and intricate workmanship.&#x201d; <br><br>In his reply, written the same day, the czar agrees: &#x201c;I am grateful to you, dear Vladimir, for the trouble you have taken in placing the order and for the execution of the order itself, which could not have been more successful.&#x201d; There is enough here to suggest that it was the cosmopolitan Vladimir who had first conceived the idea to order an egg from Faberg�. It is the closing sentence of the czar&#x2019;s letter, however, that truly intrigues: &#x201c;I do hope the egg will have the desired effect on its future owner.&#x201d; What &#x201c;effect&#x201d; on his wife did the czar have in mind? What, in fact, was the nature of their marriage?<br>Alexander III had taken the throne following the gruesome assassination of his father, Alexander II, a few weeks before the Easter of 1881. On Sunday, March 1, the old czar was on his way back from the ceremonial changing of the guard at the Mikhailovsky riding school in Saint Petersburg when a bomb was thrown under his carriage. The explosion damaged the vehicle, killing and injuring part of the escort, but the czar himself was unharmed. Ignoring his driver&#x2019;s pleas to speed on, he stepped down from the carriage and began speaking to the wounded men, questioning the captured bomb thrower, and praising his own good fortune at a lucky escape. Almost immediately, a further assassin ran forward. Shouting &#x201c;It is too early to thank God,&#x201d; he launched a bomb that exploded directly at the czar&#x2019;s feet. <br><br>Alexander was still alive, but only just. His legs had been torn away and his stomach ripped open, yet he still had enough strength to whisper a last command: &#x201c;To the palace, to die there.&#x201d; He was obeyed. Dripping blood up the marble staircase, his body, not yet a corpse, was carried into the Winter Palace. There the imperial family gathered around the deathbed. Among them were the future Alexander III; his wife, Marie Fedorovna, still clutching the ice skates she had been about to put on when the news of the bomb had reached her; and their son Nicholas, aged thirteen and dressed in a blue sailor suit. All were there when the surgeon made the expected announcement: &#x201c;The emperor is dead.&#x201d; <br><br>Russia had a new czar: Alexander III. Hearing the surgeon&#x2019;s words, he turned from the window through which he had been staring, nodded, and gave a few swift instructions to the chief of police. Then he and Marie walked out of the palace and stepped into a waiting carriage. In the words of his cousin Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovitch, another witness to the deathbed scene, &#x201c;In less than five minutes he had acquired a new personality. Something much bigger than a mere realization of the imperial responsibilities had transformed his massive frame.&#x201d;</p><h2>Who Gets Grandma&#39;s Yellow Pie Plate?

His dangerous trip became a pilgrimage, a luminous journey of the heart. The astonishing spiritual odyssey of a man in search of himself.</p><p>In the autumn of 1973, the writer Peter Matthiessen set out in the company of zoologist George Schaller on a hike that would take them 250 miles into the heart of the Himalayan region of Dolpo, "the last enclave of pure Tibetan culture on earth." Their voyage was in quest of one of the world's most elusive big cats, the snow leopard of high Asia, a creature so rarely spotted as to be nearly mythical; Schaller was one of only two Westerners known to have seen a snow leopard in the wild since 1950.<p> Published in 1978, <i>The Snow Leopard</i> is rightly regarded as a classic of modern nature writing. Guiding his readers through steep-walled canyons and over tall mountains, Matthiessen offers a narrative that is shot through with metaphor and mysticism, and his arduous search for the snow leopard becomes a vehicle for reflections on all manner of matters of life and death. In the process, <i>The Snow Leopard</i> evolves from an already exquisite book of natural history and travel into a grand, Buddhist-tinged parable of our search for meaning. By the end of their expedition, having seen wolves, foxes, rare mountain sheep, and other denizens of the Himalayas, and having seen many signs of the snow leopard but not the cat itself, Schaller muses, "We've seen so much, maybe it's better if there are some things that we don't see."</p><p> That sentiment, as well as the sense of wonder at the world's beauty that pervades Matthiessen's book, ought to inform any journey into the wild. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Peter Matthiessen was a naturalist, explorer and writer. His works of fiction include At Play in the Fields of the Lord, Far Tortuga and the acclaimed &#39;Watson Trilogy&#39;.

She lives with her family in South Carolina.Four gorgeous nighttime predators bid farewell to bachelorhood in this uneven quartet of sensual paranormal romances. Surprisingly, Feehan's "Dark Hunger," depicting the romance between an immortal Carpathian and a spirited shape-shifter, is the weakest of the lot. Feehan struggles with the short form; she tries to cram everything she would normally put in a novel&#x2014;multiple conflicts, a full cast of characters and an abundance of love scenes&#x2014;into a mere 100 pages, and the result is a frenetic tale lacking emotional intensity, plausibility and focus. The stories improve progressively, however, with Shayne delivering a tightly wrought werewolf romance in "Awaiting Moonrise" and Holly offering a sexy, shockingly kinky romance ("The Night Owl") between a vampire and a smalltown baker. The most inventive of the four is "Seduction's Gift." Knight imagines a magical world where Magi, immortal champions of humankind commonly referred to as "witches" and "vampires," wield their powers to save humanity from itself. These immortal champions include the legendary King Arthur, Guinevere and the hero of this tale, Lord Lancelot du Lac, assassin and High Court seducer. All the stories suffer to some degree from an overabundance of lust and sex and a dearth of emotional connection, but fans of the genre aren't likely to mind. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The best in her field at rebuilding faces from bare skull bones, Eve specializes in identifying missing children. When billionaire John Logan requests her help in identifying an adult skull, Eve--already swamped with work--tells Logan that she isn't interested. But when he volunteers to donate a large sum of money to a charity for missing children in exchange for her time, Eve reluctantly agrees. Logan neglects to tell her that there are powerful, desperate people who are determined to keep the skull's true identity a secret at any cost. Eve's gut instincts tell her that Logan is holding back vital information: Does the billionaire really believe that he's uncovered new insight into the Kennedy assassination? Or does the skull tie him to a mysterious murder? Eve's wildest guesses don't even come close to the stunning truth that she discovers when she at last studies the restored face. Now she and Logan have proof of a dark secret that could get them killed. And it will take all of their combined cunning and sheer nerve to survive. Well plotted, meticulously researched and spine-tingling, <i>The Face of Deception</i> is a fast-paced game of hide-and-seek, as Eve and Logan race to stay one step ahead of relentless pursuers while accomplishing the delicate, high-tech restoration for which Eve is famous.

The summer&#x2019;s Normandy invasion had finally succeeded and the Germans had been driven out of northern France and most of the Low Countries. In September the invasion of France&#x2019;s southern coast had met less opposition and Allied divisions had begun lining up along the Rhine. <br><br>But while the Americans were about to meet a nasty surprise in the Ardennes, the Germans never did let go of the province of Alsace, and in a hard pocket around the city of Colmar continued to resist. On New Year&#x2019;s Eve they launched a counteroffensive, Operation Northwind, that nearly put Allied forces back on their heels. While the Allies were eventually able to take care of their Ardennes problem the Colmar one still remained. On January 12, 1945, Eisenhower could only tell George Marshall, &#x201c;It is a very bad thorn in our side today." <br> <br>This is the story of the Sixth Army Group (7th US &amp; 1st French Armies) which fought on the southern flank of the SHAEF front. The French had multiple problems during this campaign so that increasing number of US divisions needed to take part. In the process the 3rd and 28th Infantry Divisions, and 10th and 14th Armored, among others were able to cover themselves with heroism, though hardly less than the threadbare German 19th Army, which bravely resisted against enormous odds until finally the west bank of the Rhine was cleared. <br><br>Amidst a horrific winter and rough terrain, interspersed by demolished towns, both sides traded blows in a ferocious campaign often neglected in histories of the war. This book informs us fully of the tremendous and costly struggle waged on that often-neglected sector of the front.<br><br><b>Table of Contents</b><br><br>1 The Sixth Army Group<br>2 The French October Offensive<br>3 Seventh Army&#x2019;s October Offensive<br>4 St. Di�<br>5 Forming the Colmar Pocket<br>6 The Belfort Gap<br>7 Stalled on the Rhine<br>8 December 1944<br>9 Operation Nordwind<br>10 Strasbourg, Again<br>11 Operation Cheerful<br>12 Colmar<br>13 February 1945<br>14 Conclusion <br><br>Appendix A&#x2014;Allied Order of Battle<br>Appendix B&#x2014;Organization of German Military Units <br>Notes <br>Bibliography<br>Index<br></p><p>Nathan N.

After the success of the Normandy invasion, as well as the expulsion of German forces from northern France and most of the Low Countries, a fierce pocket of German resistance around the city of Colmar continued to frustrate Allied forces. This last-ditch holdout was so fierce that in January of 1945, President Eisenhower said to George Marshall, It is a very bad thorn in our side today." Eisenhower's Thorn on the Rhine examines this military juncture from all perspectives; chapters describe in detail the military strategies utilized and their repercussions, as well as the hardships and bravery of troops pressed to their limit on both sides.

But then prospectors chanced first upon the world's richest deposits of diamonds, and then upon its richest deposits of gold. What followed was a titanic struggle between the British and the Boers for control of the land, culminating in the costliest, bloodiest, and most humiliating war that Britain had waged in nearly a century, and in the devastation of the Boer republics.<p> Martin Meredith's magisterial account of those years portrays the great wealth and raw power, the deceit, corruption, and racism that lay behind Britain's empire-building in southern Africa. Based on significant new research and filled with atmospheric detail, it focuses on the fascinating rivalry between diamond titan Cecil Rhodes and Paul Kruger, the Boer leader whose only education was the Bible, who believed the earth was flat, yet who defied Britain's prime ministers and generals for nearly a quarter of a century. <i>Diamonds, Gold and War</i> makes palpable the cost of western greed to Africa's native peoples, and explains the rise of the virulent Afrikaner nationalism that eventually took hold in South Africa, with repercussions lasting nearly a century.</p></p><p><b>Martin Meredith</b> is a journalist, biographer, and historian who has written extensively on Africa and its recent history.

Martin Meredith captures the colours and textures of the land and brings to life the extraordinary figures who peopled it and whose influence lingers on. His descriptions of Rhodes and Kruger, of Robinson and Barnato and all the other actors, rogues and heroes of this epic drama played out upon the scorched African veldt are filled with fascinating insights and rich with anecdotes which bring them bursting from these pages.

She and her husband, Bill, coauthor a series of Victorian-Edwardian mysteries under the name Robin Paige, which includes such titles as <i>Death at Glamis Castle </i>and <i>Death at Whitechapel</i>.*Starred Review* This whimsical, amiable, enchanting, gentle, and charming tale is the fifth (and best) in Sharon Wittig Albert&#x2019;s series featuring Miss Beatrix Potter. It succeeds on many levels and for many audiences. Readers should not expect a traditional mystery as there is no murder; instead, there is a series of intrigues to be untangled by the tactful Miss Potter. The puzzles include the death of the antiquarian Hugh Wickstead (killed by a falling treetop), a fireball burning down a barn, the mysterious appearance of a long-lost sister of Mr. Wickstead, and a missing treasure. This is also a fantasy, with talking animals and dragons who seem to know more about the puzzles than any of the humans. In true old-fashioned style, the narrator is omniscient and regularly tells the reader information to which the book&#x2019;s characters are not privy. This technique was used by Potter herself in her little tales and by Baum in the Oz books. There is also a real-life romance beginning to flourish between the two &#x201c;real&#x201d; characters, Beatrix Potter and her solicitor, Will Heelis. On yet another level, this is an engaging historical novel imparting much information about the life of Beatrix Potter in December 1909 in the village of Near Sawrey in the Lake District of England.

Today, more than half of the world's population lives in urban areas, and that number is growing. Weaving together archeology, history, and contemporary observations, Monica Smith explains the rise of the first urban developments and their connection to our own. She takes readers on a journey through the ancient world of Tell Brak in modern-day Syria; Teotihuacan and Tenochtitlan in Mexico; her own digs in India; as well as the more well-known Pompeii, Rome, and Athens. Along the way, she presents the unique properties that made cities singularly responsible for the flowering of humankind: the development of networked infrastructure, the rise of an entrepreneurial middle class, and the culture of consumption that results in everything from take-out food to the tell-tale secrets of trash.<br><br><i>Cities</i> is an impassioned and learned account full of fascinating details of daily life in ancient urban centers, using archaeological perspectives to show that the aspects of cities we find most irresistible (and the most annoying) have been with us since the very beginnings of urbanism itself. She also proves the rise of cities was hardly inevitable, yet it was crucial to the eventual global dominance of our species--and that cities are here to stay.</p><p><b>Monica L.

It's the ancient trash dump of Monte Testaccio. Right in the middle of the city, it is a giant mound of broken pottery where the ancient Romans threw away the containers used to ship wine and olive oil all around the Mediterranean. Each of those vessels was about half the height of a person and made of coarse clay that would have roughed up a stevedore's hands. Their odd shape of two handles and a pointy base made them good for packing into a ship's hold or standing upright on a sandy shoreline but very inconvenient for much else. After a cargo of them arrived at its destination on the bustling shores of the Tiber at the very heart of the Roman world, a few were reused and a few were recycled. Mostly, people poured out the contents and threw the containers away. Over the centuries, the pile of discards grew, with the result that one of the famous hills of Rome is actually not a hill at all but a human construction-a landfill, essentially. Today Monte Testaccio is topped by trendy nightclubs and has been endlessly mined for construction, but there are still the remains of twenty-five million ancient containers poking up from the vegetation of the hillside.<br>Now consider a very different metropolis. My favorite part of Tokyo? The backside of the Tsukiji fish market, the part that tourists don't visit. Tsukiji is enormous, and the passageways are crowded with plastic buckets and barrels teeming with every kind of creature that you can imagine from the briny deep. Crabs attempt to crawl their way out of baskets, little fish are piled up in ice buckets, and great slabs of tuna glisten under the klieg lights. The market is open to everyone, with chefs and restaurant owners jostling with homemakers for a clearer view of the day's catch. It's a world without friendly chitchat, punctuated by the dangerous darting movements of souped-up forklifts that dodge their way in and out of the building and heap up their discards out back. Behind the market is an enormous dump of plastic-foam shipping boxes used to transport the globally sourced tuna, squid, and shrimp from each morning's auctions. The pile of containers is taller than a two-story building and so large that it is continually cleared by bulldozer. Some of the cartons are trampled and broken in the process, with bits and pieces that spill farther into the passageway. In between the endless runs of machinery, merchants and their helpers come to pick through the heaps of box fragments. Sorting through the pile to find ones that aren't too broken, they carry them off to repack with fish or whatever else they're selling.<br>Ancient Rome and modern Tokyo are literally a world apart, but if we stand back and look at them as cities, they have identical characteristics. In addition to markets and trash, there are multistory buildings, long streets, sewer pipes, water mains, public squares, and a "downtown" zone of financial institutions and government offices. There are a thousand varieties of sounds and smells, competing with the weather and daylight that frame the skyline of the built environment. There are crowds of people-rich, poor, young, old, female, male, gay, straight, trans, abled, disabled, employed, students, jobless, residents, and visitors. Production and consumption opportunities are scaled up in cities to provide not only more things but also more things per person, a completely ironic abundance given that urban residences tend to be much smaller than their rural counterparts. In the midst of so much abundance, the only solution is to cycle through possessions faster, turning everything into trash.<br>It's the act of discard that provides the most telling evidence of urban activity, whether it's a broken potsherd from two thousand years ago or a fragment of a plastic crate that was shattered this morning. Once you start to look for the concentrated detritus of your own urban life, it's everywhere: in the trash cans that bear the proud logo of the downtown business improvement district; in the Dumpster parked outside a building that signals a renovation taking place inside; in the garbage truck that obstructs your commute; in the legions of sanitation workers employed to sweep the streets and subways and haul away the accumulations of discards. Trash has a familiar rhythm and concentration. Holidays bring a hangover of extra-full trash bins; parades and festivals and summer weekends in the park are witnessed through their aftermath of overflowing containers. Whether directly or by proxy, an urban obsession with trash is everywhere, and once you start to look, you won't be able to stop seeing it. Congratulations! You're an archaeologist.<br>Moving your gaze upward, or to the side, you might notice that it's not just trash that silently tells a story of urban life. Your own metropolis, even if it's new, has many traces that reveal its history before you moved through its streets. Maybe it's a bolt hole in the sidewalk where a telephone booth used to stand, or an out-of-use railroad track now embedded in the asphalt of a city street. Maybe it's a building that has been updated once or twice, resulting in the pastiche of a Victorian facade with mirrored glass windows, or a modernist concrete structure fronted by flowers and cheerful painted windowsills. And maybe it's a newly cut ditch in the street where you can see the layered pavements of prior years right up to the present. Buildings and streets and parks serve as a living map of variable time, a collection of structures that all exist simultaneously whether they were constructed a millennium ago, in your grandparents' time, or last week.<br>Your growing archaeological insights serve you well when looking not only at modern cities but also at the ancient cities that are found by the hundreds on nearly every continent, from famous ones such as Rome to not-so-famous ones with romantic names like Tikal, Tell Brak, and Xi'an. When we look beyond the rubble and ruins, what we unearth in our excavations of them rings true to the experiences that we have in our own cities: neighborhoods and streets, open plazas and grand buildings, lines of sight to the residences of the powerful, and marketplaces where people from all walks of life met their daily needs for food and fuel. When we walk through the streets of an ancient city like Pompeii, we encounter an environment where everything makes sense, from the sewer grates and the narrow passageways between apartment buildings to the food stalls and the cocky ancient graffiti scribbled on the walls. Although there's a popular impression that ancient cities were prone to collapse, the vast majority of the world's first cities are still right underfoot in the biggest metropolitan areas today: not only Rome and Xi'an, but also London, Paris, Guangzhou, Mexico City, Tokyo, Baghdad, Cuzco, Cairo, Athens, Delhi, Istanbul . . . the list goes on. And those cities became interconnected with other cities that sprang up alongside them, growing into a global phenomenon that dominates the planet. Today, more than 50 percent of the world's people live in cities, and that percentage will soon be larger. It's predicted that by 2030, more than 50 percent of Africans, 60 percent of Chinese, 87 percent of Americans, and 92 percent of the residents of the United Kingdom will live in cities.<br>In their layouts and constructions, ancient cities look so much like the ones we build for ourselves that it seems they should always have existed. And the growth and success of modern cities also suggest that humans thrive in urban locales. But cities are not actually the natural condition of our species, nor did we humans need to develop cities in order to survive or to successfully colonize the world. For a million years, our ancestors had lived scattered across the landscape, housed in humble huts in everyone-knows-everyone villages. By the time cities were invented six thousand years ago, our ancestors had already done a good job of filling up all of the easy places to live and many of the difficult ones, too. They had a system of pathways to get across the land, and they had developed rafts and boats to get from place to place across the trackless water. They had moved out of caves and other natural shelters into huts that they built themselves out of stone, bamboo, or brick. People had a sophisticated repertoire of language, art, music, and dance to pass the time, and they had many ways of displaying their individual identities through ornaments and tattoos and hairstyles. They already had reverence for the dead, encoded in the placement of burial goods laid to rest with the deceased. There were plenty of objects for the living, too, because people had already invented all the essentials of life. There were clothes to keep warm, plows to till the land, pottery and baskets to keep the harvest safe, and stone knives and bronze weapons to carve up food (and to keep enemies in check). There were domesticated plants for a steady supply of beer and bread, and domesticated animals as a ready source of milk, wool, transportation, and companionship. In sum, we had everything we needed for a successful life of small-scale farming that would still have allowed for population growth to cover the planet, one little village at a time.<br>Clearly, that simple and straightforward village life wasn't enough for our urban ancestors. Despite having everything that members of our species needed to survive, people wanted plenty of intangible things that they couldn't get out there in the countryside: the thrill of a crowd, the excitement of new inventions and novel foods, and the tantalizing allure of meeting a romantic partner from beyond the confines of the village. Before there were cities, such experiences could be found only in ritual spaces that people might visit once or twice in a lifetime. Located far away from settlements, ritual places like Stonehenge provided the only escape from village life where people from different areas could gather together for the purpose of celebrating a festival or honoring a deity. Drawn to those places by some distinctive point of topography, people often added special ritual architecture meant to be the focus of collective attention and to serve as a proof of collective action.<br>By bringing people together for a shared purpose, ritual places made it possible for people to develop and practice the skills of communication and interaction that enabled them to deal with so many strangers. Yet places like Stonehenge, however appealing, were only temporary: people were not meant to stay there beyond a few days of feasting and worship. Only cities could make that opportunity for intense interaction permanent and for a much greater range of purposes-social, economic, political-than could ever have been envisioned for a ritual space. Summed up in a phrase, it's "bright lights, big city" with all of the connotations of enticements and activity that we continue to experience in our own urban centers today. Cities were the homes of human creativity, manifested not only in culture, fashion, and fine arts but also in small things like clothing, ornaments, housewares, food, and hairstyles. Through the acquisition of a constantly changing array of objects, people living in cities proclaimed new alliances and new senses of self; even if they could not purchase stylish new goods regularly, they could talk about what was fashionable in a vicarious and free appropriation of urban style.<br>Before cities, there was only a landscape of villages in which every family was more or less the same, consisting of farmers and herders who experienced very little ethnic or social diversity. Every house was the same, too, except for the chief's house or the shaman's house, which might have been a little larger or that had a few different artifacts that enabled their occupants to do the special jobs of leadership and curing the sick. And the shamans kept their secrets to themselves: those objects weren't for everyone to touch, or see, or know about. Everyone else did the same work, day in and day out, and everyone had the same basic repertoire of food and objects. Those objects were solid and sober, with styles and decorations that had stood the test of time. Social interactions were solid and sober, too. People might have had a little fun when they were young or when they went on an occasional trip to a distant wedding or on a once-in-a-lifetime pilgrimage. The majority of their days, however, were spent in an atmosphere where they knew everyone else. In the modest farming settlements that people built all over the globe, there was very little movement in or out of the community. People spent their entire lives in the company of the same people, and almost everyone was related. New faces appeared only at the time of marriage or when itinerant peddlers came with their wares. Familiarity was the constant measure of human relations, and strangers were regarded with wariness and misgiving.<br>Places like Rome and Xi'an and every other ancient metropolis represent a spectacular change in the way that humans related to their environments and to one another. In urban settlements, unfamiliarity became the measure of human relations. The first cities were larger than the largest family-like village, and the people who moved into those settlements had to suppress a suspicion of others from the very first day. People had to adapt to densely crowded neighborhoods full of people they had never seen before; they had to negotiate ritual and political relationships with other newcomers; and they had to accept the near-constant dissonance of interacting with people representing different cultures, languages, and customs. Encounters with strangers were no longer limited to the occasional addition of a newlywed to the collective hearth, but constituted a recurring condition of daily life. People moved in and out of the city, coming and leaving as new opportunities opened up. As they worked, played, and shopped, urban residents had to constantly update their roster of relationships.<br>Urban social life and the entrepreneurial spirit associated with migration constituted a feedback loop that enticed more and more people who were looking to better their circumstances. Before cities, there wasn't a middle class as a group of people who have income that can support activities beyond the range of basic life and who can make some investments in housing and objects and education. Before cities, there wasn't infrastructure-all of those pipes and highways and drains that suddenly became necessary as a way to logistically connect large groups of people. And before cities, there wasn't even take-out food! All of those were invented only as cities came into existence, and they all come together: the middle class, the objects, the physical networks of connectivity, and the trash. It's as though there was a pent-up capacity for all of those things that had somehow been encoded into our collective conscious, just waiting for an opportunity to burst forth.</p></p><h2>You&#39;re the Only One I Can Tell: Inside the Language of Women&#39;s Friendships</h2><p><b>This warm, wise exploration of female friendship from the #1 <i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestselling author of <i>You Just Don&#x2019;t Understand </i>will help women lean into these powerful relationships.</b><br><br><b>A <i>WASHINGTON POST </i>NOTABLE BOOK</b><br><br> Best friend, old friend, good friend, bff, college roommate, neighbor, workplace confidante: Women&#x2019;s friendships are a lifeline in times of trouble and a support system for daily life. A friend can be like a sister, daughter, mother, mentor, therapist, or confessor&#x2014;or she can be all of these at once. She&#x2019;s seen you at your worst and celebrates you at your best. Figuring out what it means to be friends is, in the end, no less than figuring out how we connect to other people.<br><br> In this illuminating and validating new book, #1&nbsp;<i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Deborah Tannen deconstructs the ways women friends talk and how those ways can bring friends closer or pull them apart. From casual chatting to intimate confiding, from talking about problems to telling what you had for dinner, Tannen uncovers the patterns of communication and <i>mis</i>communication that affect friendships at different points in our lives. She shows how even the best of friends&#x2014;with the best intentions&#x2014;can say the wrong thing, and how words can repair the damage done by words. Through Tannen&#x2019;s signature insight, humor, and ability to present pitch-perfect real-life dialogue, readers will see themselves and their friendships on every page.

They both felt this was too long, so they arranged to get together. When Kathryn arrived at Lily&#x2019;s home, they sat down and talked. And talked. And talked. They didn&#x2019;t stop, and they didn&#x2019;t get up, until two and a half hours had passed. They talked about books they were reading, their significant others, politics, movies, their children, their children&#x2019;s children, and how their bodies and their living situations were changing with age Later, they exchanged emails. Lily wrote, &#x201c;That was a wonderful and soul-�lifting visit, my dearest old friend. Will let you know about the movie.&#x201d; Kathryn replied, &#x201c;I felt the same way about our time together.&#x201d; Her email ended, &#x201c;Let me know about the movie, and if we go to the other one I will let you know about that. Take care, dear friend.&#x201d;<br><br>Andrea recalls that she and her best friend in middle school, Joelle, walked home together every day. They could take a bus, but they usually chose to walk instead so they would have more time to talk. At one point, there was a chance that Joelle&#x2019;s family would move to another state. The prospect of losing her friend filled Andrea with dread. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t be able to live without her,&#x201d; she felt. &#x201c;If she moves, how will I survive?&#x201d; That feeling is usually associated with a life partner or parent. But a connection to a friend can be that strong, too. A deep sense of loss can result when a friendship ends. As with a romantic partner, losing a friend means losing a language. No one else can understand the particular meanings of words that you shared, the references that made you laugh or nod in understanding. That loss is a testament to the power of conversation&#x2014;�of talk&#x2014;�to create a connection, a shared world.<br><br>If a friend who is part of your daily life moves away, a hole is left that is palpable every day. Paula and her neighbor Nancy became fast friends by running together every morning before work. When Paula stepped out to pick up the paper in the morning, she faced Nancy&#x2019;s house. During the winter months when days were shorter and mornings still dark, seeing the light in Nancy&#x2019;s kitchen made her smile. It filled her with warmth to know that her friend was up, too, also preparing coffee and breakfast. Then Nancy and her family moved. Paula felt forlorn. She wasn&#x2019;t motivated to run before work if Nancy wasn&#x2019;t going with her. To her surprise, she found herself regarding the woman who bought Nancy&#x2019;s house as an interloper. Now if Paula steps out to get the paper and spies a light in the kitchen across the way, though she knows it makes no sense, she feels resentment toward the woman who is moving around in Nancy&#x2019;s kitchen.<br><br>A friend&#x2014;�just one single friend&#x2014;�changed the life of a girl named Maya. At eleven, Maya had never had a friend. Though she badly wanted one, she simply did not know how to relate to other children. As her much older sister, Chana Joffe-�Walt, explained on the radio show This American Life, Maya had many of the traits associated with the autism spectrum: &#x201c;sensitivity to touch, lack of eye contact, obsessive and intense interest in one topic, and difficulty with social emotional reciprocity, what many of us call conversation.&#x201d; Having struggled her entire young life, Maya &#x201c;had amassed a team of therapists&#x201d; and &#x201c;a series of diagnoses that all seemed to take her most obvious character trait and add the word &#x2018;disorder&#x2019; to it.&#x201d; Despite the efforts of these experts, Maya &#x201c;stopped asking for playdates altogether. She stopped reading. She stopped smiling, and sleeping. And she was on edge all the time, especially at school. A kid would take her pencil or brush up against her at the bus stop, and Maya would blow up. She had to be physically restrained. She broke a window. She was diagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder. She got hospitalized for a brief period.&#x201d;<br><br>Then the miracle happened. Maya went to a horse camp, race horses being her obsession. And there she met Charlotte, who became her friend. Charlotte and Maya had playdates. They laughed together. They had sleepovers. Until then, children had kept their distance from Maya. But Charlotte told her mother, &#x201c;Maya is perfect.&#x201d; Maya&#x2019;s life changed so dramatically that her family referred to BC and AC, life Before Charlotte and After Charlotte. Maya herself explained that through Charlotte she learned how to relate to other people: &#x201c;Be more flexible. Not just talk about what you want to talk about all the time. Do other stuff that your friend wants.&#x201d; After two years of their friendship, Maya at thirteen &#x201c;feels the feelings that come when you&#x2019;re a girl and you have a friend who makes you laugh, and thinks about you when you&#x2019;re apart, and gets you.&#x201d; Maya was transformed. She &#x201c;no longer regularly gets in trouble at school. She now does her homework and washes her hair without a struggle. She has not had one violent incident AC. She makes eye contact sometimes. She asks, &#x2018;How are you?&#x2019; sometimes. She does chores. That felt impos�sible BC. All of it seemed impossible BC.&#x201d; A friend accomplished what a decade of experts and therapists couldn&#x2019;t.<br><br>She Was There for Me<br><br>Having a friend means feeling less alone in the world. You have someone to talk to, someone to do things with, someone you can call on when you need something&#x2014;�or, even better, who will come through without being called on. I heard accounts of friends volunteering help in vastly different contexts. When Aisulu Kulbayeva, a linguistics graduate student, talked to women in a village in Kazakhstan about their friendships, they told her of women coming through with help when needed, and of sharing what little they had. One woman, Valentina, explained that she has a niece who is also a friend. When either visits the other, she always brings something, like candy for the children. And if her niece&#x2019;s husband has gone fishing, she will bring Valentina a fish. When Valentina&#x2019;s father died, her niece came over as soon as she heard, helped at the funeral, and helped Valentina cook for the many guests who came not only for the funeral but also for traditional gatherings on the ninth and fortieth days following her father&#x2019;s death. Switching to present tense, Valentina explained that during that time, in order to be there for Valentina, her niece &#x201c;leaves all her household chores. The only thing she goes home for is to milk the cow.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She was there for me&#x201d; is something many women said when telling me about friendships they treasured. Some of the most moving stories I heard were of friends who came through in difficult times, and they spanned the ages and stages of women&#x2019;s lives. One woman recalled how her friends rallied around her when she faced a challenging life �circumstance&#x2014;�in the third grade. Her family was going through a difficult time that her classmates got wind of. Her close friends did not ask for details&#x2014;�that in itself was a gesture of friendship&#x2014;�and they worked as a team to protect her. If a too-�curious classmate seemed poised to ask questions that might be hard for her to deal with, her friends would move in and encircle her, so the inquisitive intruder could not get to her&#x2014;�literally or figuratively. I heard many accounts of friends bringing over meals and providing rides to medical facilities when a friend fell ill. Several women told me of friends who lived in distant cities coming to help when they were recovering from surgery&#x2014;�and staying for a week or more. A woman described how, following a painful divorce, her friends helped her turn the run-�down condo she moved to into a home: &#x201c;They came over with their rubber gloves and their buckets. It was like the maid brigade. They showed up to get down and dirty and gritty, because I was sort of dysfunctional at that point. I could do stuff, but I couldn&#x2019;t organize it.&#x201d;<br><br>On the other hand, a woman, Shirley, talked of an opposite experience. When her husband began showing the debilitating signs of Parkinson&#x2019;s disease, Shirley said, &#x201c;There were women friends&#x2014;�women I thought were my friends&#x2014;�who just disappeared.&#x201d; Particularly disappointing was the reaction of a couple who had been among their closest friends for years. As Shirley&#x2019;s husband&#x2019;s illness worsened, the wife&#x2019;s visits became more sporadic, and her husband&#x2019;s stopped altogether. The wife told Shirley: &#x201c;My husband can&#x2019;t handle seeing your husband that way.&#x201d; The hurt in Shirley&#x2019;s voice was evident as she said, &#x201c;We had to live with his Parkinson&#x2019;s every day, and she&#x2019;s telling me her husband can&#x2019;t stand it for an hour.&#x201d; The experience led Shirley to contemplate the meaning of friendship. &#x201c;If a friend isn&#x2019;t there when you need her,&#x201d; she mused, &#x201c;what is a friend?&#x201d;<br><br>One woman answered this question by saying that a true friend is someone she could &#x201c;call at three in the morning and say I need $100 for an airplane ticket.&#x201d; The same wee hour came to the mind of a woman who told me that if a friend called her at three in the morning and said, &#x201c;I need bail,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d reply, &#x201c;Okay, can I come in my nightie? I&#x2019;ll be right there.&#x201d; These scenarios were hypothetical, but I heard many real-�life accounts of friends who jumped in a car or on a plane when a friend faced dire circumstances, such as that most unimaginable loss, the death of a spouse. One woman, when her friend&#x2019;s husband died, flew across the country immediately and stayed to show her friend how to do the many things that he had done: write checks, balance a checkbook, shop for food and cook dinner. After returning to her own home, she called on the phone&#x2014;�and continued to call every day for a year. Even when she was physically distant, she was there for her bereaved friend&#x2014;�through talk.<br><br>The circumstances needn&#x2019;t be cataclysmic for friends to come through by being there to talk. Another woman recalled a next-�door neighbor &#x201c;who called me one day when her son had dropped a jar of mayonnaise and smeared it around all over the kitchen floor then put eggs in it because he was going to make a cake. And she just left the mess and came over. We drank coffee and commiserated with each other.&#x201d;<br><br>It&#x2019;s All Talk<br><br>&#x201c;For girls and women, talk is the glue that holds a relationship together.&#x201d;<br><br>When my book You Just Don&#x2019;t Understand: Women and Men in Conversation was published, I said this so often in interviews that my mother would tease me by chanting the sentence back to me. I&#x2019;d always go on to add, &#x201c;For boys and men, it&#x2019;s activities that are central. For girls, your best friend is the one you tell everything to. For boys, your best friend is the one you do everything with&#x2014;�and the one who will stick up for you if there&#x2019;s a fight.&#x201d;<br><br>Studies of children at play, such as Marjorie Harness Goodwin&#x2019;s He-�Said-�She-�Said, found that girls and boys tend to play with others of the same sex, and to use language differently when they do. Typically, girls&#x2019; social lives are centered on a best friend, and they spend a lot of time sitting and talking, especially exchanging secrets. Boys talk, too, of course, but they tend to do it differently and for different purposes. Typically (though, obviously, not every child is typical; patterns should not be misconstrued as norms), boys use language to take center stage by boasting, telling stories, making jokes, or telling others what to do&#x2014;�all ways of establishing their status in the group, and also ways of talking that girls find unacceptable in other girls. A boy who issues commands to others and gets them to stick is the leader. A girl who tries to tell others what to do is bossy, and the other girls don&#x2019;t want to play with her.<br><br>Observing the ways children use language in same-�sex play sheds light on differences in how women and men tend to use language among friends as adults. Students in my classes observing their own conversations frequently describe contexts where the young women talk and the young men use action. Here&#x2019;s an example provided by Erika Duelks.<br><br>Saturday night, after a party, a group of us went to Matt&#x2019;s house to hang out before we went home to bed. I (and the other girls) proceeded to sit down on the couch and we began talking about the night: what we thought was fun, what we wished had happened, etc. I was in the middle of giving my friend Sarah advice about a boy when all of a sudden the coffee table was pushed out of the way and the guys began to wrestle, throwing each other onto the couch and pushing each other off chairs. It was funny for me to see my big guy friends wrestling as if they were five-�year-�olds, but it also struck me that this is how we chose to relax: the girls began talking . . . and the guys got up and started play-�fighting.<br><br>If the boys were acting like five-�year-�olds by roughhousing, Erika and her friends were also acting like five-�year-�olds&#x2014;�five-�year-�old girls&#x2014;�by sitting and talking.<br><br>I&#x2019;ve often asked audiences, &#x201c;When did you last communicate with your closest friend?&#x201d; Most women raise their hands to indicate &#x201c;this morning,&#x201d; &#x201c;yesterday&#x201d; or &#x201c;within a week.&#x201d; A few women&#x2019;s hands go up to show &#x201c;within a month.&#x201d; But many men, and very few women, raise their hands to indicate it has been a year or more. When I ask this question in conversation, men often say, &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t spoken to him in a year&#x2014;�but if I needed him, he&#x2019;d be there.&#x201d; If talk is the glue that holds a relationship together, you have to talk to your friend to maintain the friendship. If friendships are focused on activities, then there&#x2019;s not much to gain by talking to friends who aren&#x2019;t there.<br><br>Journalist Jeffrey Zaslow was intrigued by the close friendships he saw his mother, sister, wife, and daughters enjoying&#x2014;�and sometimes suffering from. Like an anthropologist who goes to live among members of a different culture, Zaslow followed a group of women who had been friends for forty years, to figure out what drives their friendships. As he recounted in his book The Girls from Ames, he quickly realized that talking about their personal lives was key to their friendships&#x2014;�and completely different from the kind of talk he and his friends engaged in. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been playing poker with a group of friends every Thursday night for many years,&#x201d; he wrote in his introduction to the book. &#x201c;About 80 percent of our conversations are focused specifically on the cards, the betting, the bluffing. Most of the rest of the chatter is about sports, or sometimes our jobs. For weeks on end, our personal lives&#x2014;�or our feelings about anything&#x2014;�never come up.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Gift Of The Blessing</h2><p>This special edition of Gary Smalley and John Trent&#39;s best-selling book offers a fresh, updated look at the life-changing gift the Bible calls &#34;the blessing.&#34; The unconditional love and approval that comes with the blessing is an important element of our self-esteem and emotional well-being.

Twenty years after the English revolution, the monarchy has been restored and Charles II sits on the throne. The men who conspired to kill his father are either dead or disappeared. Baltasar &#x201c;Balty&#x201d; St. Michel is twenty-four and has no skills and no employment. He gets by on handouts from his brother-in-law Samuel Pepys, an officer in the king&#x2019;s navy.<br> <br>Fed up with his needy relative, Pepys offers Balty a job in the New World. He is to track down two missing judges who were responsible for the execution of the last king, Charles I. When Balty&#x2019;s ship arrives in Boston, he finds a strange country filled with fundamentalist Puritans, saintly Quakers, warring tribes of Indians, and rogues of every stripe. Helped by a man named Huncks, an agent of the Crown with a mysterious past, Balty travels colonial America in search of the missing judges. Meanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic, Samuel Pepys prepares for a war with the Dutch that fears England has no chance of winning.<br> <br>Christopher Buckley&#x2019;s enchanting new novel spins adventure, comedy, political intrigue, and romance against a historical backdrop with real-life characters like Charles II, John Winthrop, and Peter Stuyvesant.

" So begins this pitch-perfect satire about Daisy, Paque, and Stella, three girls from Arizona who are hungry for fame. Styling themselves after their idols, Bananarama, they form a pop band called Masterful Johnson. It isn't long before Stella quits the band to head for LA and become an actress, where she ends up rooting through celebrity garbage, performing macabre dinner theater, and lusting after bad-boy rocker Brian Metro. Paque and Daisy, however, continue with the band. After a string of embarrassing misadventures-including a fashion show at the local mall where they share the stage with a ten-year-old exhibitionistic gymnast-they're about ready to call it quits. But when a senator's son and his friend are mysteriously murdered, Paque and Daisy, the last people to see the victims alive, become the prime suspects in the case. Cashing in on their sudden notoriety, they record an EP, entitled We're Masterful Johnson, and the adventure is only beginning. . . </p><p>Funny and clever, suffused with droll 80's nostalgia, <i>We're So Famous</i>, like the best satire, is fresh and compelling on the surface, and wicked underneath.</p></p><p><p><b>Jaime Clarke </b>was born in Kalispell, Montana, and educated at the University of Arizona and Bennington College. He lives in Brooklyn, New York.</p>In its attempt to skewer our obsession with celebrity culture, this trifle of a tale about three teenage girls and their quest for fame and fortune only manages to injure itself. Narrated in three parts, the novel follows the exploits of Paque, Stella and Daisy, talentless teenagers from Phoenix, Ariz., with an overwhelming desire for fame. Obsessed with the British girl group Bananarama (Paque and Daisy are avid '80s aficionados), the two record an amateur single that gains notoriety when they are linked to a local murder case. But this plot line is abandoned, and their singing career goes nowhere following a disastrous live performance. Stella, a struggling actress living in Hollywood, works in a dinner theater reenacting celebrity deaths (her obsession) with her new boyfriend, an actor who can't get beyond failed television pilots. Paque and Daisy join her in Hollywood to work on a no-budget movie with a no-name director. Will Paque and Daisy hit the big time? Will Stella's stalking of bad-boy rocker Bryan Metro bear fruit? Will readers be at all amused by the book's incessant name-dropping, pop culture factoids and the postmodern trick of slipping screenplays and faux fan letters into the narrative? Not likely although those who find Nick Hornby and Bret Easton Ellis too challenging might be engaged for a moment or two. Satire needs to be smarter than its subject, and unfortunately this fable is neither wicked nor clever enough to wade out from the shallows it purports to spoof. (Apr. 9) Forecast: A blurb from Ellis probably won't do much to boost sales after the first 15 minutes, and it's hard to tell who the intended audience is: readers under 30 won't be familiar with much of the '80s arcana and those over 30 won't have the patience for the puerile protagonists. <br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Streams of History: Ancient Greece (Yesterday&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>Presents the chief geographical features of Greece and historical sketches of the life of the people at four stages of their development: Age of Homer, Persian Wars, Age of Pericles, and Age of Alexander the Great.

What's her secret? Perhaps it's because, as an official royal photographer, she did not provoke the fear and panic that outside photographers tragically did, and her status as the only woman in the pool of royal photographers somehow put the royal family and the Princess of Wales off their guard in her presence. <i>Diana: Portrait of a Princess</i> contains never-before-seen photos from the early 1980s until Diana's death in August of 1997. Fincher captures the shy, awkward Lady Spencer, the picture of innocence and bewilderment thrust onto the global stage. Later in this chronologically ordered collection we see this young woman evolve into the glamorous and sophisticated princess. Some of the most striking images reflect the raw emotion and revealing intimacy in Diana's life, such as the private moments in which you can sense her fiercely tender devotion to her sons. Many of the natural, spontaneous shots depict a deeply distressed woman, trapped in a world of conformity, while still other pictures illustrate the growing strain in her loveless marriage to Prince Charles. Royal writer Judy Wade worked with Fincher to provide the text to go with these, the best of Fincher's 30,000 candid images of Princess Di.Jayne Fincher's award-winning photographs have appeared in major newspapers and magazines around the world including <i>Newsweek, People, Paris Match, Stern,</i> and <i>Life.</i> In 1988, to celebrate his 40th birthday, Prince Charles asked Fincher to take the official family portrait of the Prince and Princess of Wales relaxing at Highgrove with their young princes. Fincher covered the funeral of Princess Diana, her most difficult assignment, about which she was interviewed on The Today Show. She is coauthor, with her father, Terry Fincher, of <i>The Princess of Wales</i> (1989), photographer of <i>My Young Friends</i> (1989), and author of <i>Travels with a Princess</i> (1990), which includes her photographs of Princess Diana and other members of the royal family.</p><h2>Anne Hooper&#39;s Kama Sutra</h2><p>The author of The Ultimate Sex Book updates sexual techniques and reinterprets ancient wisdom for modern lovers, in a fully illustrated guide that features specially commissioned photographs and information on ways to enrich and diversify one&#39;s sex life. 100,000 first printing.</p><p>One might think a former <i>Penthouse Forum</i> magazine editor would be in over her head when it came to interpreting the sacred <i>Kama Sutra</i> for contemporary lovers. Surprisingly, Anne Hooper has grasped the subtle, but more important, messages of India's traditional love manuals. She discourages readers from focusing on accomplishing distorted poses, as if they were athletic feats. Instead, she has written a compelling commentary that encourages readers to emphasize pressure points, manners, artistic freedom, and most of all finding and pursuing a loving sexual relationship rather than an overly choreographed one. Almost every page is illustrated with tasteful photos of nude lovers demonstrating the many sacred positions, while Hooper's text offers suggestions on how to apply the ancient teachings to contemporary lovemaking. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>Anne Hooper, best--selling author and member if the Association of Sexual and Marital Therapists, specializes in working with people with sexual, personal, and emotional problems.

Her life is a fascinating one, filled with hard work,<br>humanitarianism, and tragedy.

She lives in North Little Rock, Arkansas.<br>Grade 5-7 The author of <i>The Head Bone's Connected to the Neck Bone: The Weird, Wacky and Wonderful X-Ray</i> (Farrar, 2001) takes on a related topic with equal success in this profile of the driven scientist most closely associated with the discovery of radium. Born Manya Sklodowska and educated in her native Poland at a Floating University that operated in defiance of harsh Russian policies, Curie moved to Paris to continue her studies. There, both before and after the tragic death of her beloved, kindred spirit Pierre, she dedicated her life to pure research and enlisted her father-in-law to care for her children. She never took out patents, so even as she was rising to international fame, entrepreneurs worldwide began trumpeting wild claims for the healing benefits of radioactive products. McClafferty chronicles both that fad and its dismal outcome, as the effects of long-term radiation poisoning slowly became horribly apparent. Noting that Curie maintained lifelong ties with her native land and also did significant medical work in WWI, the author follows her career to its final, illness-ridden days, then ends with an apt summation of her legacy. Archival photos and substantial multimedia resource lists enhance an engrossing study of a great scientist who tried to turn away from the world and ended up changing it profoundly.<i> John Peters, New York Public Library</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Trying to regain her footing, she has signed on to tutor the teenage daughter of a well-to-do couple as they spend a sultry summer in their oceanfront New Hampshire cottage. <br><br>But when the Edwardses' two grown sons arrive at the beach house, Sydney finds herself caught up in a destructive web of old tensions and bitter divisions. As the brothers vie for her affections, the fragile existence Sydney has rebuilt is threatened.<br><br>With the subtle wit, lyrical language, and brilliant insight into the human heart that has led her to be called "an author at one with her m�tier" (<i>Miami Herald</i>), Shreve weaves a novel about marriage, family, and the supreme courage it takes to love.<br><br>"Shreve excels at nuance and detail. She skillfully illuminates the tiniest of moments, offering readers a peek at the complex undertones coursing through the characters throughout the story." -Rocky Mountain News<br><br>"There is something satisfyingly clean, well functioning, pale, and delicious about an Anita Shreve novel. . . . Shreve's characters, grappling with desire, juggling their shame against their regret, are entirely welcome." -Boston Globe<br><br>"Shreve's writing is textured, reflective, and generally flows with ease, to the point where the reader may be surprised at how quickly the pages turn." <em>-</em>Newsday</p><p>The beach house in New Hampshire which figured in Anita Shreve's <i>The Pilot's Wife</i>, <i>Fortune's Rocks</i>, and <i>Sea Glass</i> is once again featured in <i>Body Surfing</i>. This time, it is the summer home of the Edwards family, Anna and Mark and daughter Julie. Mrs. Edwards has great hopes for Julie, who is "slow," so she hires Sydney to tutor her, in preparation for her senior year. There are two older brothers, Jeff and Ben, whose arrival changes the household dynamic considerably. <p> Once again, Shreve revisits the minefield of love and betrayal that she has explored so well in her best novels. Sydney is 29, twice married, once divorced, and once a widow. She is floundering, not sure she wants to go back to school, accepting whatever job comes along and then moving on. She answers the ad for a tutor and finds herself in the Edwards household, where she discovers that Julie has undiscovered artistic talent. Mrs. Edwards dislikes her instantly, is dismissive, and treats her like a servant. Mr. Edwards befriends her, shows her his roses and talks to her about the history of the house, giving the reader a rundown of the role the house has played in prior novels. </p><p> Sydney, Jeff, and Ben go body surfing late one night and Sydney is sure that Ben has tried to grope her underwater. She takes immediate umbrage at this and treats him coldly thereafter. Shreve's other work has a steady narrative flow, but this novel is episodic and disjointed. There is the the arrival of Jeff's girlfriend, her departure, an evening when Julie comes home drunk and won't talk about it, and a liaison between Sydney and Jeff which leads to the complications that eventually define the novel. There is a twist at the end, involving the brothers, that is divisive, destructive and rather hard to believe. </p><p> While this is not Shreve's best effort, because the characters are not well-defined, it is worth reading her take on what happens to people when they compete for love. <i>--Valerie Ryan</i></p>Anita Shreve is the critically acclaimed author of twelve books, including The Pilot&#39;s Wife, which was a selection of Oprah&#39;s Book Club, and The Weight of Water, which was a finalist for England&#39;s Orange prize.

She lives next to a cornfield in central Illinois.New Zealand serves as the alluring backdrop for Atherton's thin 15th paranormal detective mystery to feature Lori Shepherd (after 2009's <i>Aunt Dimity Slays the Dragon</i>). At the request of dying spinster twins Ruth and Louise Pym, Lori heads down under to find out what happened to their older, disinherited brother, Aubrey Pym. In New Zealand, Lori discovers Aubrey is dead, and his son, Edmund, soon follows Aubrey to the grave. As a result, Lori must deliver the vital message the Pym sisters entrusted to her to Ed's 18-year-old runaway daughter, Bree. As Lori tours such scenic sites as Waipoua Forest and Tongariro National Park in her hunt for Bree, Aunt Dimity's journal provides otherworldly encouragement. Since Peter Jackson is filming the <i>Lord of the Rings</i> trilogy during Lori's visit, Tolkien references abound. What starts as a missing person's case turns into a travelogue, charming but not very mysterious. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

G. Jung, James Hillman, and Joseph Campbell, Bosnak meditates on the metaphoric, therapeutic, and philosophical implications of dreamwork.&nbsp;&nbsp;This thoughtful and inspiring guide draws on Bosnak's experience as a therapist a traveler, and a dreamer, and is an invitation to look more closely at the meaning of this fundamental and common aspect of human existence -- and to contemplate the astonishing creative capacities of the soul.</p><p>Robert Bosnak currently trains analysts at the C. G. Jung Institute in Boston.That month, after my father's death, I became driven to perform a ritual in my office at the end of each week.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the wall behind my chair, over the fireplace--which used to warm the Cambridge, New England, Victorian room years before I moved in to make it my psychoanalytic office in 1977--hangs an unidentifable tool that used to belong to an ancient woodstove.&nbsp;&nbsp;A thick cast-iron shaft elbows up in aspiration to a circle at the top, while staying solidly connected to a circle at the bottom end below.<br><br>After the death of my father I began to touch the bottom circle, cupping it with my left hand at about the height of my head.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I would close my eyes and see the galaxy.&nbsp;&nbsp;My vision would travel in a spiral along this Milky Way to the center.&nbsp;&nbsp;There I'd see my father's scalp, with his pride of white hair he loved to comb back in a V between bald, glistening skin (though I never thought of my father as bald).&nbsp;&nbsp;It would hover in the center of the galaxy, where the light was most dense.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many tiny stardust dots would become a cloud of white starlight.<br><br>Then I would say "Thank you for all you have given and for all you have not given.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now take it all back." I'd send off the turmoil and leave for my leisure at home.&nbsp;&nbsp;My rational self grins with imperious superiority at these childish antics, but to this day, three years later, the foolishness continues to ritualize itself at the conclusion of each week.<br><br>Ilyatjari the ngamkari, an Aboriginal spirit doctor of the Pitjantjabara people of central Australia who treats body and soul, sits across from me.&nbsp;&nbsp;His dark, shining face, with curious eyes that observe me with intense dispassion, is all business.&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows how far I've traveled--across continents and hemispheres--and what little time I've got.&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to talk with me.&nbsp;&nbsp;How do I want to use this less than a week? I tell him that I want to discuss dreams with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a formality, since I had written to anthropologist Diana James, who speaks his language, months before this initial trip to the Australian outback, asking her if she knew of an Aboriginal dream doctor willing to meet with a Western dream doctor to discuss our trade.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilyatjari had agreed.<br><br>"Shall I first tell you how I work?" I ask, so he can observe my work.&nbsp;&nbsp;He nods after receiving the translation.&nbsp;&nbsp;He, his wife, and his sister-in-law obviously think it an excellent idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;They sit on the burnt-sienna powder-kne sand, comfortable in their dusty clothes.&nbsp;&nbsp;My clothes are getting there, but they still have some leftover cleanliness of half a world back, where I packed them in my black backpack.&nbsp;&nbsp;I sit on a travel stool, minding my back, although later, in the heat of our conversation, I will move down to sit closer to them. A speckled brown mutt sleeps stretched out behind llyatjari.<br><br>I randomly choose the last dream I worked with, since the work is still fresh in my memory.&nbsp;&nbsp;It had been the dream of a young white man, presented at a Melbourne dream practicum (a dreamwork training using live material of participants).&nbsp;&nbsp;While talking, though, I realize his story is about myself as well; the choice has not been random.<br><br>"The day before yesterday, this man in his early thirties presented me with a dream I worked on," I begin.&nbsp;&nbsp;The dream involves a car.&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that llyatjari travels the red desert in a four-wheel-drive vehicle.&nbsp;&nbsp;We had seen him enter the camp in a cloud of dust, driving the car from the right hand side, as they tend to do down under, grinning at Diana in an impish kind of way.<br><br>"This young man is driving a car from the driveway of his powerful house in England.&nbsp;&nbsp;A great Western home.&nbsp;&nbsp;A mansion.&nbsp;&nbsp;He can hear the sound of the pebbles on his driveway.&nbsp;&nbsp;He loves driving the car.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an open car.&nbsp;&nbsp;Very powerful.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he gets to the highway and begins to drive full speed.&nbsp;&nbsp;The motor screams.&nbsp;&nbsp;Full throttle.&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, the motor is doing too many rpms (revolutions per minute) and it is beginning to hiccup and stall, leaping forward, then stopping, shaking the car in nauseating commotion.&nbsp;&nbsp;The driver hears the screaming of the motor, until he realizes that there is a woman sitting next to him screeching at the top of her lungs, terrified.&nbsp;&nbsp;The driver is shocked and wakes up, shaken."<br><br>Diana concludes her Pitjantjatjara rendition.&nbsp;&nbsp;All three elders nod.&nbsp;&nbsp;The desert around us is silent, contrasting with the speed of the driven.<br><br>"That is the dream.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, here is what I did.&nbsp;&nbsp;I first asked the dreamer to feel the power of the car.&nbsp;&nbsp;He could feel the power deep down in his body, down to his groin, his genitals, and it felt exhilarating and potent.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I help him feel the motor, screeching along, not able to satisfy his demand for speed and power, overdoing it.&nbsp;&nbsp;He can feel the impact on the body.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very typical Western male dream," I add.&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's why so many Western males end up with heart attacks from working too hard.&nbsp;&nbsp;They're driven.&nbsp;&nbsp;The motor is making more rpms than it can take."<br><br>As Diana translates I note that they follow me, that they hadn't experienced before.&nbsp;&nbsp;That feeling of vulnerability he is left with, after he goes through the fear of the woman himself, is essential to his life.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is this fear that makes him push people away.&nbsp;&nbsp;Experiencing the fear deeply may actually reduce it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Avoiding this fear by driving himself ever harder is dangerous.&nbsp;&nbsp;It makes him isolated, distant from people.&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a lonely man.&nbsp;&nbsp;He drives people away.<br><br>"Maybe now he can be with a woman without driving her away, maybe now he can have a family." I conclude this brief synopsis of the Melbourne dreamwork, becoming aware of the fact that the importance of family is<br>something universal, which everybody understands.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of llyatjari's grandchildren are making a racket in the background, together with Diana's six-year-old son.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have made the dreamer appear more isolated and terrified than he had actually been in Melbourne, but I wanted to bring out the full potential impact of such a dream.<br><br>"That is a good way of working," llyatjari relays back to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;I blush.&nbsp;&nbsp;The two women are moved at the thought of this terror-driven young man with speed in his heart to the point of breaking.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their eyes are moist.<br><br>"How does he work?" I ask Diana.<br><br>Ilyatjari's dark brown face looks like that of the gnomes we used to hear about in childhood fairy tales deeply worked, serious but with a playful gleam in his eyes as he tells a story to Diana, who will translate his tale section by section.&nbsp;&nbsp;Around us is the rust-colored earth, worn and brittle, as though the world were made of dust.&nbsp;&nbsp;Myriad little flowers shimmer, speaking of the recent rains that made the desert flourish.&nbsp;&nbsp; The trees look like they live off drought, with their parchment skin of dried-out bark that ought to be dead but isn't.</p><h2>The Outlaws of Sherwood</h2><p>The author retells the adventures of Robin Hood and his band of outlaws who live in Sherwood Forest in twelfth-century England</p><p>Robin McKinley has won various awards and citations for her writing, including the Newbery Medal for <i>The Hero and the Crown</i> and a Newbery Honor for <i>The Blue Sword</i>.

Braving the sexism of the scientific world, she joined the prestigious Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry and became a prominent member of the international physics community. Of Jewish origin, Meitner fled Nazi Germany for Stockholm in 1938 and later moved to Cambridge, England. Her career was shattered when she fled Germany, and her scientific reputation was damaged when Hahn took full credit&#x2014;and the 1944 Nobel Prize&#x2014;for the work they had done together on nuclear fission. Ruth Sime's absorbing book is the definitive biography of Lise Meitner, the story of a brilliant woman whose extraordinary life illustrates not only the dramatic scientific progress but also the injustice and destruction that have marked the twentieth century.</p><p>Awards won for this title include: Watson Davis and Helen Miles Davis Prize, History of Science Society 1998; Silver Medal for nonfiction, Commonwealth Club of California 1997; Finalist, PEN Center USA West 1997; Choice Outstanding Academic Book Award; Best Books List, Library Journal 1996"Deprived of the Nobel Prize she so clearly deserved for her contribution to the discovery of nuclear fission, Lise Meitner has never been given the attention she deserves in the history of twentieth-century physics.

"Even though you may have played a course a hundred times, chances are your approach shot rarely lands in the same place on the green." <i>How to Give Her Absolute Pleasure</i> was written for men who want to please women. Much of the book focuses on foreplay (Paget comments that we need to rename it) designed to "excite both her mind and her body." The author offers a variety of strategies for romancing and relaxing a woman and making her feel comfortable. If you don't, she claims, "nothing you can do can rev her engine". Then she describes ways of "kissing her, touching her, and teasing her." Paget includes "a topographical guide" of a woman's body, starting with the sensual areas of the head and face and moving down. She describes ways to massage, caress, lick, kiss, and otherwise excite all these regions. She also discusses lubricants ("slippery, slidy, marvelous stuff"), condoms, manual stimulation, "the art of tongue," sex toys, and a variety of positions (clearly illustrated) for everything you might do. The book is in no way formulaic--in fact, Paget continually stresses that some women love having a particular body part touched in a certain way, while others can't stand it. Whether you're a novice or consider yourself sexually sophisticated, you'll learn plenty from Paget. <i>--Joan Price</i>Advance Praise for <b>How to Give Her Absolute Pleasure</b>:<br><br>"<b>How to Give Her Absolute Pleasure</b> is based on what real men really want to know!"<br>--Barbara Keesling, Ph.D., author of <b>Getting Close</b> and <b>Sexual Healing</b><br><br>"<b>How To Give Her Absolute Pleasure</b> is the quintessential guide to women's bodies and what they want sexually.

Now, as the great dragon overlords of the Fifth Age coldly plot to strengthen their rule and to destroy their enemies, he must somehow find the will to redeem himself. But perhaps it is too late.<br><br>Downfall marks the return of Dhamon and other characters from author Jean Rabe's bestselling Dragons of a New Age trilogy.<br></p><p>It's not easy being Jean. For some Dragonlance fans, the world of Krynn ended with Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman's <i>Dragons of Summer Flame</i>. Many Lancers would just as soon forget Jean Rabe's famously awful Fifth Age kickoff trilogy (<i>The Dawning of a New Age</i>, <i>The Day of the Tempest</i>, and <i>The Eve of the Maelstrom</i>), and that's putting it nicely. (Imagine the Comic Book Guy from the <i>Simpsons</i> saying, "Worst fantasy author <i>ever</i>," and you'll begin to understand the enmity that Rabe has generated for herself.)<p> But Weis and Hickman returned triumphantly to the Fifth Age with <i>Dragons of a Fallen Sun</i>, proving that the reports of Krynn's death were, at worst, an exaggeration. So maybe--just maybe--Rabe deserves a fresh start in Dragonlance, too. <i>Downfall</i> begins a trilogy revolving around Dhamon Grimwulf, former Knight of Takhisis, ex-Hero of the Heart, and erstwhile co-protagonist of Rabe's aforementioned Dragons of a New Age series. Dhamon is on the outs, running around robbing the sick and the weak in cahoots with a kobold, a tattooed half-elf floozy, and a suspiciously powerful thief-wizard named Maldred. (Hmmm, there's something fishy about that guy...) In rolls plate-mail babe Fiona (a spit-shined Knight of Solamnia) and pirate-turned-good-guy Rig Mer-Krel, presumably to clean up Dhamon and set him on the straight and narrow. But faster than you can say "Charm Person," the entire crew ends up on the road together, heading off to bargain with an ogre chieftain, rescue a herd of goats, and ransom Fiona's brother from the black dragon overlord Sable. Or so they think. Quite a few switchbacks and blind canyons here, enough to keep you wondering what's around the next corner, but don't expect emotional, involved Weis-and-Hickman fare: while many Dragonlance fans would consider it damning praise, <i>Downfall</i> reads a lot like a decent Forgotten Realms adventure. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p></p><h2>To Live Is To Die: The life and death of Metallica&#39;s Cliff Burton</h2><p><p>Metallica, the seventh-biggest recording act in American history, are consummate musicians--but it wasn't always that way. A significant proportion of their playing expertise was acquired from a pivotal three-year period in their history--1983 to 1986--during which their music, a potent variant of thrash metal, evolved from garage level to sophisticated, progressive heights thanks to the teachings of their bass player, Cliff Burton. The San Francisco-raised Burton, born in 1962, pushed the band to new musical levels with his musical training, songwriting ability and phenomenal bass guitar skills. Across three albums--Kill 'Em All (1983), Ride The Lightning (1985) and Metallica's undisputed masterpiece, Master Of Puppets (1986)--Burton's awe-inspiring playing, derived from a unique blend of classical and punk approaches, received worldwide recognition from fans and bass players alike. He was the first heavy metal bassist since Black Sabbath's Geezer Butler to regard the bass as a lead instrument, delivering intricate live solos based on classical fugues and even laying down a solo track on Metallica's debut album. Cliff's life was short but influential; his death was sudden and shocking. At the age of just 24, he was killed when Metallica's tourbus overturned on a remote Swedish mountain road in the early hours of September 27, 1986 for reasons which have still not been ascertained: he was crushed to death after being thrown from his bunk through a window. The driver, who has never been identified, told the rest of the band that the bus had hit black ice, leading to the accident: singer James Hetfield refused to believe him and has often spoken publicly about his doubts. With Cliff's death, Metallica's most critically acclaimed period of activity ended. They went on to record huge-selling albums, but by their own admission never pushed the creative envelope as radically as they had done in the first four years of their career.</p></p><p><p><b>Joel McIver</b> is the bestselling author of <i>Justice for All: The Truth About Metallica</i> which has been translated into 9 languages. He has written for Rolling Stone, The Guardian, Metal Hammer, Classic Rock, and he is the occasional guest on BBC. He is currently the editor of Bass Guitar magazine. Classic Rock magazine has called him "by some distance Britain's most prolific hard rock/metal author." He wrote the official biography of the world's biggest death metal band, Cannibal Corpse and co-wrote Megadeath's bio from bass player David Ellefson.</p></p><h2>When There Is No Miracle</h2><p>No stranger to personal pain and tragedy, Dr. Robert Wise has seen miracles happen in his own life, in the lives of his family members, in the lives of others. Yet he is keenly aware of the times God is silent, the times when pain and tragedy seemingly go unanswered and unexplained. In a day when miracles are being considered almost commonplace by some and when many people suffer feelings of guilt because their prayers are not being miraculously answered, Dr. Wise has written a clear and comforting word to help any believer walk by faith through trouble or trauma. Here is a book that grapples realistically and hopefully with the unanswerable myusteries and questions that face us all.</p><p>Dr. Robert Wise, Ph.D., pastor of an Evangelical Episcopal church in Oklahoma City, author, lecturer, and Bible teacher, is known throughout this hemisphere, in Europe, and in the Far East. The author of twenty books, his works have been translated into German, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, and are widely read in Europe. He is married and the father of four children."Dr. Robert Wise is a personal friend and colleague whom I have gone to many times throughout my life for answers to the tough questions we all face in life. I am a psychiatrist and hear these questions very frequently. . . . In <i>When There Is No Miracle: Finding Hope in Pain and Suffering</i>, Wise tackles one of the toughest questions that we all struggle with. He gives excellent insights for dealing with suffering, pain, and even death in a way that will enable readers to recover more quickly from these difficult times as well as build a foundation that prepares us for whatever the future may hold. I recommend this book highly." (Paul Meier, MD, Author, psychiatrist, &amp; founder of the national chain of nonprofit Meier Clinics 2016-08-03)<br><br>"During the past three or four years, I have participated in many healing services, read many books on the subject, and yet &#x2018;there was no miracle.&#x2019; The thorough way in which Robert Wise has anticipated the questions facing a person with no miracle has touched me deeply. In every chapter there is fresh strength to see God&#x2019;s long-range viewpoint instead of my short-sighted one." (Rosalind Rinker, author of Prayer: Conversing with God 2016-08-03)<br><br>"Robert Wise, in his exceptional book <i>When There Is No Miracle: Finding Hope In Pain and Suffering</i>, invites us to join with him as he receives and dispenses the godly wisdom obtained through years of counseling the victims of grief. And, as he so eloquently puts it, 'sooner or later, tragedy will march into your own living room.' It has taken Archbishop Wise thirty years, as a social worker and then a pastor, to write and then rewrite this extraordinarily helpful, positive, and inspirational book. <i>When There Is No Miracle</i> catalogs a lifetime of stories of grief and tragedy in those around him and in his own incredible life, peppered with his numerous personal, intimate conversations with Jesus. The book positively guides you through the exasperation and disappointment of a prayer not answered or the miracle not received. With transparency and compassion, Wise delivers numerous illustrations of God&#x2019;s incredible timing along with His grace, His mercy, and the unbelievable healing power of His love." (S. Bryan Hickox, Emmy-winning television producer 2016-08-03)<br><br>"The title of this book should be the footprint for a well-lived life. As faithful as you can be, as steadfast as you go through life, as hopeful as you remain, the hardest thing to live through is being left behind. This book should be recommended reading for understanding that an unanswered prayer doesn't mean that God doesn't love you. It is because you prayed for something that wasn't meant to be."

His final race at Toronto's Woodbine Racetrack is a touchstone memory for horse lovers everywhere. Yet while Secretariat will be remembered forever, one man, Eddie "Shorty" Sweat, who was pivotal to the great horse's success, has been all but forgotten---until now. <br>In<i> The Horse God Built,</i> bestselling equestrian writer Lawrence Scanlan has written a tribute to an exceptional man that is also a backroads journey to a corner of the racing world rarely visited. As a young black man growing up in South Carolina, Eddie Sweat struggled at several occupations before settling on the job he was born for---groom to North America's finest racehorses. As Secretariat's groom, loyal friend, and protector, Eddie understood the horse far better than anyone else. A wildly generous man who could read a horse with his eyes, he shared in little of the financial success or glamour of Secretariat's wins on the track, but won the heart of Big Red with his soft words and relentless devotion.<br>In Scanlan's rich narrative, we get a groom's-eye view of the racing world and the vantage of a man who spent every possible moment with the horse he loved, yet who often basked in the horse's glory from the sidelines. More than anything else,<i> The Horse God Built </i>is a moving portrait of the powerful bond between human and horse.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Lawrence Scanlan is the author of six bestselling books, including<i> Wild About Horses </i>and<i> Little Horse of Iron.</i> He is the coauthor, with Ian Millar, of<i> Riding High,</i> and has written three books for younger readers:<i> Big Ben, Horses Forever,</i> and<i> The Horse's Shadow.</i> Scanlan worked closely with Monty Roberts on his acclaimed book<i> The Man Who Listens to Horses.</i> Winner of three Canadian National Magazine Awards for his journalism, Scanlan lives in Kingston, Ontario.Chapter One <br>Red Horse, Black Angel <br>Eight in the morning north of Lexington under a bright summer sun, and this corner of the sprawling theme park in Kentucky already has the feel of a lively small-town fair.

The big Rolex eventing competition takes place here, along with dressage and rodeo and hunter/jumper shows and Pony Club rallies. The park is a mecca for the horsey set and will be the site of the 2010 World Equestrian Games. <br>Earlier, a volunteer at the entryway dropped into my hand a keepsake--a Secretariat button. Inside a white circle is the head of a red horse wearing blue-and-white blinkers, red for the horse's chestnut coat, blue and white the colors of Meadow Stable. From trees inside the park hang oversized blue pennants with the same image at the top and, below, these words: <br>Secretariat <br>Bronze Statue <br>Unveiling <br>July 17, 2004 <br>Secretariat.com <br>Browsers are cruising the tents and filling up their shopping bags, apparently undeterred by the lofty prices of almost everything. The only free thing here is Big Red gum, with packets going to anyone who can answer this skill-testing question. (Warning: If you didn't get "Who's buried in Grant's Tomb?" you may not get this one, either.) "What was Secretariat's nickname?" a cheery woman in a red T-shirt asks me while offering a pack of Big Red gum. A huge poster at her kiosk announces the 2004 Secretariatfest and the prospect of "officially licensed merchandise"--Secretariat teddy bears and key chains, little plastic Secretariat snow globes, Big Red pens. I pass the test, get the gum, and try some. It's awful. Awful pricey describes some of the art here, and I am reminded of this fact: Many are drawn to the memory of a great horse and many are trying to capitalize--sometimes artfully, sometimes in a tacky way. <br>I, too, am drawn to the memory of a great horse. My mission--to paint a fresh portrait in words of the great Secretariat--has brought me to this unveiling thousands of miles from home. I've caught wind, you see, of a curious fact: The bronze we are about to see will feature not just the horse, with his jockey up, but the groom. Think of all the bronzes, paintings, even photographs of legendary horses. In most, the horse alone is captured for posterity, and in some works of art, the jockey has a place on the great runner's back. The groom, the lowly groom, is almost never depicted. <br>I have hardly begun my journey, but already there's a theme for the book cooking in my brain. The theme is connectedness between a human and an animal, and day by day I'm realizing that the exquisite horse whose story I would tell had forged a profound connection with the man who cared for him--cared for him in every sense of the phrase. And it seems that Secretariat's sculptor and I are of the same mind. We want to honor the one rarely honored: the groom. <br>Ron Turcotte has arrived at the park in his wheelchair. He has driven all the way from New Brunswick, Canada, in his van and hooked up in Lexington with his brother, Aurele, who has flown down from his home in Quebec. Air travel, Ron Turcotte tells me, is a nightmare for those who use wheels to get around. He gave up on it a long time ago. He's wearing a blue blazer with a round decal over his heart that shows a stylized horse and jockey in a Stars and Stripes motif. The jacket is the one they gave him when he was inducted into Thoroughbred Racing's Hall of Fame at Saratoga in 1979. On Turcotte's right lapel is a pin that depicts the Secretariat postage stamp issued in 1999. <br>The memorabilia buyers soon suss him out and line up to have him sign their framed photos of Secretariat, bobble-head dolls, posters, framed art, T-shirts, and ball caps. Turcotte is wearing a sea blue cap of his own. breed more secretariats, it reads. <br>A vendor is trying to persuade Turcotte to sign a ceramic jockey's boot--a replica of the one he wore during his Triple Crown rides, black, with wide brown trim at the top. Vendor and jockey seem to be negotiating. This is what baseball, football, and hockey players complain about: merchandisers who use an athlete's signature to jack up the price of their wares. I am astonished by the range and the sentimentality of some of these wares, and I wonder, Who buys these trinkets? And do china-shop rules apply? If Turcotte drops the ceramic boot, is it, de facto, his? <br>An old jock like Turcotte is used to autograph hounds and he doesn't mind keeping them waiting while he poses for photos with some track cronies. One is another ex-jockey, Bobby Ussery, who rode against Turcotte umpteen times and Secretariat a few times. He is wearing a U.S.A. ball cap and a blue shirt with the top three buttons undone to reveal a hairy, fleshy chest and about a pound of gold jewelery at his neck. The two old jocks are laughing, with Turcotte telling some tale from decades ago--something about wrestling in the tack room with another jockey for possession of a wallet. <br>The old jocks reminisce in the way that war veterans do: They never talk of actual fighting, only of the jolly stuff before and after battle. Jockey Jerry Bailey (he rode Cigar and retired in 2006) once said that his work is so dangerous that jockeys count themselves lucky if they come through a race unscathed. Imagine what it's like to be a jockey. Imagine bending your knees as if you were sitting in a chair (without the support of an actual chair), and maintaining that crouch for minutes, your calves and thighs straining while a great deal happens all around you. Other riders and their horses advance and recede; they may jostle and bump your horse, and there is the ever-present risk that your horse will catch the heels of the one in front--with catastrophic results. Your saddle is tiny, the perch precarious, and you'd better have fine balance. You need soft hands to feel the horse through the reins, you need great strength to hold him, and you need dexterity to switch the crop from one hand to the other. You need, above all, guts. Did I mention that your "chair" is five feet in the air and moving along at forty miles an hour? <br>"It's not really if you're going to get hurt when you become a jockey," Bailey said, "it's how many times, how severe, and you hope that you don't take the big hit, which is being paralyzed." <br>In his official biography, The Will to Win, Ron Turcotte concedes that it was not death he feared on the racetrack, but paralysis. His worst nightmare unfolded in the eighth race at Belmont, July 13, 1978, when he was aboard a filly named Flag of Leyte Gulf. The filly clipped the heels of another and down he went--slung like a stone from a shot, as he later drew the picture. It was the jockey's last race, number 20,281. <br>Ron and Aurele Turcotte take time to pose for a five-minute-sketch artist who--for nine dollars--will capture your likeness and set it on a cartoon horse. "Put a little wrinkle in my forehead," Ron tells the artist. "It was always there." Or was it? He seems playful with his brother and his old pals, somewhat wary and bored with strangers. He was a gifted and much-honored jockey, whose fortune, and misfortune, was to ride a perfect horse. When that horse lost the odd race, the second-guessers came out of the woodwork. Turcotte's face is puffy and pale, and I'm told he battles chronic pain, heart trouble, and all manner of infection, yet there is mischief in those eyes, too. <br>Early in his career, Ron Turcotte learned that a young groom was helping himself to the jock's supply of Chiclets. On another occasion, a groom was nicking his doughnuts. Turcotte's cure, in the first instance, was to fill a Chiclets box with Feen-a-mint, a laxative, and, in the second instance, to bait a jelly doughnut in the same manner. In the tack room or on the track, Turcotte played for keeps. <br>Down the way, the still-youthful Eddie Maple, in black wraparound sunglasses, blue jeans, and a blazer the color of racetrack turf, has similarly been circled by fans clutching shopping bags teeming with Secretariat trinkets. Maple was the last man to ride Secretariat in a race, at Woodbine, in Toronto, more than three decades ago. <br>"Why do we still care about Secretariat?" I ask him as he signs. <br>"The fact," he replies, as if reading off a shopping list, "that he was the first horse to win the Triple Crown in twenty-five years, the way he won the Belmont, the fact that he was a beautiful horse." <br>"Was he smooth?" a young girl asks him before handing him her eight-by-eleven poster to sign. Maple asks, and receives, permission to borrow the back of another girl as he affixes his signature. "One of the smoothest horses I ever rode," he replies while signing, an answer that seems to please both girls immensely. The girls are wide-eyed, and I would bet the house they are Pony Clubbers. In the ample paddocks behind them, dozens of sleek horses and elegantly attired riders are trotting and cantering through their warm-ups. All those horses and riders act as if they are the thing and we are the backdrop, but from the vantage point of the tents, it is the other way around. <br>Inside the largest of the white tents, with the Secretariat bronze hidden behind a tall white curtain, several hundred people have gathered to witness the moment of unveiling. Some have lined up in the sun for an hour or more to get choice spots near the bronze. <br>Donna Brothers--an ex-jockey whose face and voice would be familiar to anyone who takes in globally televised broadcasts of the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness, and the Belmont (mounted on a track pony, she interviews the winning jockey right after each race)--acts as master of ceremonies and introduces speakers as they approach the lectern. The lineup is impressive: Secretariat's owner, two jockeys and an exercise rider, and one of the horse's biographers. <br>Jimmy Gaffney, one of the big chestnut's old exercise riders, says, "Secretariat was the greatest racehorse that ever lived." Gaffney started galloping horses when he was sixteen years old and rode horses at tracks all over the country. Age and emphysema and, more recently, throat cancer have put a halt to all that. Until just a few years ago, he worked at the track as a pari-mutuel clerk. If, for example, you put five dollars on Woebegone to win the fourth, a clerk such as Gaffney will punch in the data and give you your ticket--which you will crumple in your fist when Woebegone comes in last. <br>Gaffney tells the throng what they want to hear, but I take from the emotion in his voice that he means what he says when he declares, "Secretariat changed my life forever. Every time I had the privilege to get on his back, I felt the incredible, awesome sense of power. It's a feeling I'll never forget." His voice breaks as he declares that while we may yet again see another Triple Crown winner, "We will never ever see another Secretariat." <br>Jimmy Gaffney was among the first to realize that Secretariat would be a great one. He used to brag about the horse on shed row--to fellow riders, to writers like Bill Nack, to his own wife and his mother. His mother sent him a pommel pad (sometimes inserted under the saddle for extra comfort) with secretariat knitted in blue letters on a white backing. Then Gaffney himself bought two blue saddle pads (the quilted cloth on which the saddle sits) and had secretariat stitched onto them, as well. Finally, he took home the exercise saddle he normally used with Secretariat and, with his leatherwork kit, hammered Secretariat into its side. All this naming and heralding long before the horse had won his maiden race. <br>Up next is Eddie Maple, who talks about the pressure he faced going into that last race at Woodbine for the Canadian International Championship on October 28, 1973. "I figured," he says, "this would have been the end of my life if something happened." He means that had Secretariat lost, a black cloud would have hung over the name of Eddie Maple until his dying day. <br>The rider gives way to the sculptor, Ed Bogucki (pronounced Bo-gook-ee), who describes a brush with death while working on the bronze. He was outside when a gust of wind blew down a heavy ladder, which would have crowned him had it not crashed onto Eddie Sweat's bronze head instead. The sculptor thanks his "black angel," but strangely, no one from Sweat's family is here. In fact, I do not see a single black face amid the hundreds here. <br>Ron Turcotte gets laughter and applause when he thanks Penny Chenery for holding the event on his birthday--his thirty-first. (He is, in fact, five days away from his sixty-third birthday.) He thanks the owner for putting him up on "the greatest horse who ever lived. I could talk about him all day long," he says. "He was a charming horse, a lovely horse, and we used to fight over who was going to get up on him." <br>Turcotte makes an interesting point about the blinkers that Secretariat wore. The horse did not actually need them, but he came to associate them with work, and this was a horse who loved to work. The blue-and-white blinkers, like the number 1A on the saddle pad he wore in the Kentucky Derby, would come to identify him. Today, reveals Turcotte, he is getting more mail about Secretariat than he did in 1973. <br>Last to speak is Penny Chenery, who remembers the exhilaration of the Belmont. "I would love to know what he was thinking that day," she says. "Why did he keep on running when he'd passed everybody by almost an eighth of a mile? My gut feeling is that it was his home track and he was ready for that race. I just think he got out there and put away Sham early and just felt 'Okay, I feel good, I'm just going to show them how I can run.' He was in the zone. There was no acceleration, no deceleration. It was the same stride. You had the feeling that he could just keep on going." <br>Chenery thanks the horse's trainer, Lucien Laurin, who, she says, "made all of us. He made Ronnie, he made Jimmy, he made me." She observes, as she has many times before, that perhaps only a "tough-minded" trainer like Laurin could have brought out the greatness in a horse like Secretariat. <br>"The other, really important part of his life," says Chenery, "was Eddie Sweat." She explains that either Eddie or exercise rider Charlie Davis ("they were great buddies," she notes) would sleep outside the horse's stall when Secretariat was shipped from track to track. "I'm sure," Chenery says, "they were a very important part of his sense of well-being." It seems a great pity that Charlie Davis is not here, either. <br>Finally, to fanfare, the tall white curtain falls away from the thirty-foot-high scaffolding and there are gasps and applause from the audience. Ed Bogucki's fifteen-hundred-pound creation is life-size and up on a pedestal, so the horse we would have looked up to at least figuratively now looms over us l...</p><h2>Fashioned to Reign: Empowering Women to Fulfill Their Divine Destiny</h2><p>Bethel pastor and bestselling author Kris Vallotton delivers a powerful, liberating teaching for women, revealing the special role and vital purpose God has for them.</p><p><b>It's Time for a Revolution<br></b><br>In the Garden, woman was taken out of man to stand by his side and co-reign with him.

When women are not honored, or when they are oppressed in society, half of the nature of God Himself is "imprisoned" in the magnificence of femininity. God commissioned both sexes to co-reign over the planet. It was only after the fall of mankind and the ensuing curse that men were given rulership over women. <br><br>When Jesus died on the cross, He destroyed the curse. But two thousand years later, most of the Church is still relegating women to the ball and chain of Eve's deception. Instead of the Body of Christ leading a revolution that honors women, the Church has actually been the catalyst for centuries of patriarchal oppression. In fact, in the last hundred years, while the world has begun to champion women and give them places of leadership in politics, business, education and every realm of society, parts of the Body of Christ will not even allow women to be elders in local congregations. <br><br>We have failed to realize that Jesus founded the women's liberation movement more than two thousand years ago.

Miller reimagines the story of Circe, &#x201c;daughter of the sun,&#x201d; and reinvents her, changing Homer&#x2019;s ruthless seductress into a woman with a restricted set of godly powers, a keen intelligence, and most important, empathy for humans &#x2013; a sentiment not shared by her godly relatives. When Circe&#x2019;s father banishes her to the island of Aiaia, her isolation from her scornful family comes as a gift, and her solitude grants her time to learn the art of witchcraft &#x2013; the only work she has ever undertaken. &#x201c;For a hundred generations, I had walked the world, drowsy and dull, idle and at my ease,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;Then I learned that I could bend the world to my will, as a bow is bent for an arrow. I would have done that toil a thousand times to keep such power in my hands.&#x201d; She summons her skills when a boatload of would-be rapists lands on her shores, but shows Odysseus mercy, and their encounter changes her forever. Back in 2012, Miller&#x2019;s novel <em>The Song of Achilles</em> earned the Orange Prize for Fiction. For her many admirers, <em>Circe</em> is certainly worth the wait. <em>&#x2014;Sarah Harrison Smith, Amazon Book Review</em>Madeline Miller is the author of The Song of Achilles, which won the Orange Prize for Fiction 2012, was shortlisted for the Stonewall Writer of the Year 2012, was an instant New York Times bestseller, and was translated into twenty-five languages.

Rather, it is a wide-ranging narrative about the movies and their signal role in modern life. At first, film was a waking dream, the gift of appearance delivered for a nickel to huddled masses sitting in the dark. But soon, and abruptly, movies began transforming our societies and our perceptions of the world. The celebrated film authority David Thomson takes us around the globe, through time, and across many media&#x2015;moving from Eadweard Muybridge to Steve Jobs, from <i>Sunrise </i>to <i>I Love Lucy</i>, from John Wayne to George Clooney, from television commercials to streaming video&#x2015;to tell the complex, gripping, paradoxical story of the movies. He tracks the ways we were initially enchanted by movies as imitations of life&#x2015;the stories, the stars, the look&#x2015;and how we allowed them to show us how to live. At the same time, movies, offering a seductive escape from everyday reality and its responsibilities, have made it possible for us to evade life altogether. The entranced audience has become a model for powerless and anxiety-ridden citizens trying to pursue happiness and dodge terror by sitting quietly in a dark room.</p><p>Does the big screen take us out into the world, or merely mesmerize us? That is Thomson's question in this grand adventure of a book. Books about the movies are often aimed at film buffs, but this passionate and provocative feat of storytelling is vital to anyone trying to make sense of the age of screens&#x2015;the age that, more than ever, we are living in.</p></p><p><b>David Thomson</b>, renowned as one of the great living authorities on the movies, is the author of <i>The New Biographical Dictionary of Film</i>, now in its fifth edition. His books include a biography of Nicole Kidman and <i>The Whole Equation: A History of Hollywood</i>. Thomson is also the author of the acclaimed <i>"Have You Seen . . . ?": A Personal Introduction to 1,000 Films</i>. Born in London in 1941, he now lives in San Francisco.THE BIG SCREEN (A Cheap Form of Amusement) <p>In 1911, William de Mille heard that a promising Canadian stage actress lately seen in <i>The Warrens of Virginia</i> (1907) was making the mistake of her life. He told the impresario David Belasco, "The poor kid is actually thinking of taking up moving pictures seriously...I remember what faith you had in her future...and now she's throwing her whole career in the ash-can and burying herself in a cheap form of amusement."</p> <p>The actress was eighteen, and for the moment she was Gladys Smith--but the name Mary Pickford awaited her, along with perhaps the greatest success and fortune any woman has yet achieved in the movies. William was the older brother of Cecil B. DeMille and as disapproving as possible of Cecil's own urge to give up theater for this new, trashy sensation. Fraternal superiority seldom works. C.B. was on his way as not just an epic figure in the business being made but also, he hoped, an immense force for good and improvement. (The de Milles were the sons of a preacher who had become a playwright. Around the turn of that century, there were so many new technologies winning the minds of people.)</p> <p>The longing for improvement and the fear of waste and worse--it is a pattern still with us, and maybe it speaks to the medium's essential marriage of light and dark, or as Mary Pickford put it in her autobiography (published in 1955), <i>Sunshine and Shadow</i>. Light and dark were the elements of film, and they had their chemistry in film's emulsion. They had a moral meaning, too. But not everyone appreciated that prospect, or credited how it might make your fortune.</p> <p>At one of their first film screenings in Paris, in the 1890s, the Lumi�re brothers told Georges M�li�s, a stage magician captivated by what the cinematograph might do for him, to put away his money: "It is an invention without a future." Yet Thomas Edison, a businessman to be sure, wrote in <i>Moving Picture World</i>, a trade paper, in 1907, that "nothing is of greater importance to the success of the motion picture interests than films of good moral tone." But Dr. Anna Shaw, a "feminist reformer," believed that a policeman should be posted everywhere movies were shown because "These places are the recruiting stations of vice." In Boston, a girl, Irene Mayer, realized that her father, Louis B. Mayer, was in the picture business and doing so well that they were about to move to California! But years later she was still asking herself, "How could a man of my father's innate conservatism have chosen show business?"</p> <p>Her answer was that Pop was "as emotional as he was"--a simple statement that requires constant examination. My experience with movie people is that nothing is more pressing or perilous in their lives than their headstrong identification with the emotion in the stories they tell. Other people in Mayer's life might have put it differently. Louis B. Mayer, once known as Lazar Meir, and born outside Kiev in 1885, was a small bull of a man who had grown strong heaving scrap iron. He was barely educated, yet he would be a shaper of minds. He was conservative but outrageous, high-minded and given to low blows, a pirate and a prison guard. As the dominant power at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for over twenty-five years, Mr. Mayer felt he owned the souls of his stars as well as their moving photographs on seven-year contracts. He had a cruel side, a violent temper, an unbridled ego. In urging his own properties to be "good," to respect their mothers, their Americanness, and his advice, he could move himself to tears. His daughter Irene admitted that she regularly confused him with God, and hardly noticed that she didn't believe in a god. Some observers decided Mayer was a fraud, the "greatest actor on the M-G-M lot." This misses a more disarming truth: he cried real tears; he was moved by his own dreams. There are still people who think they run the media who are swept away by that great hope.</p> <p>When Mayer was an infant still, his father, Jacob, took the family to England simply to escape pogroms and poverty. That setting forth showed some means as well as the courage that every emigrant requires. Jacob was in the scrap business, but he could not prosper in England. So in 1892 they all moved on to St. John, New Brunswick, the town where Louis Mayer was raised.</p> <p>Similar stories could be told about most of the founding fathers in the picture business. Adolph Zukor (the future chairman of Paramount) was born in Hungary in 1873. Samuel Goldwyn was from Poland, born in 1879. Carl Laemmle (the founder of Universal) was born in Germany in 1867. William Fox was born in Hungary in 1879. The eventual Warner brothers (Harry, Albert, Sam, and Jack) had their family origins in Poland. Harry Cohn's father, Joseph, was born in Russia--and Cohn and a brother would form Columbia, the company that employed the logo of the famous statue holding a torch up for those huddled masses, beckoning them into movie houses.</p> <p>They were all Jewish. The only native-born Americans among the movie pioneers were Jesse Lasky and Cecil B. DeMille, and maybe that's why that pair worked together to make <i>The Squaw Man</i> (1914), allegedly the first feature-length picture produced in Hollywood. The Jewishness cannot be underestimated. The people who established the business were outsiders, anxious to be regarded as Americans, as well as people who had suffered every kind of ethnic prejudice from disdain to pogrom. When Victor Fleming (born in Pasadena) took over the directing of <i>Gone With the Wind</i> in 1939, he barely disguised his dislike of Jews (such as David O. Selznick, who produced the picture). So movies were made into a business by people who had recently escaped their own huddled masses, from families that did not always speak English. Against that set of anxieties, these early moviemakers were accustomed to storytelling, sentimental narrative theater, broad comedy, and the miracle of wondrous things never seen before: the dream that comes true. California was the embodiment of that change in life, the steady sunshine that followed European overcast.</p> <p>By 1899, Louis Mayer was in St. John still, and Canadian (his father had taken citizenship), a teenager in the scrap business. It was in 1904 that he crossed the border and went to Boston. His purpose was to observe the familial duty of getting married. The Mayers had learned of a Margaret Shenberg, the daughter of a kosher butcher in Boston ready to be wed--letters and photographs had been the means of courtship (you can marry a photograph; at the movies you can fall in love with it). Margaret, according to their daughter, was "astonished by his single-mindedness and ardor." But others reckoned Mayer simply wanted to get to America.</p> <p>This ardor, ambition, and na�vet� fell on moving pictures. In 1907, Mayer learned he could purchase a six hundred-seat burlesque house in Haverhill, Massachusetts, the Gem (known locally as the Germ), for $600. He moved his family from Boston to Haverhill, refurbished the house, called it the Orpheum, and opened for business at Thanksgiving, with "clean, wholesome, healthy amusement." On Christmas Eve he ran a double bill, two-reeler films (twenty to thirty minutes each) of <i>The Passion Play</i> and <i>Bluebeard</i>--Christian salvation and mass murder.</p> <p>He had two daughters by then, and a rapidly growing business. "Never mind now," he told his family, "this is short. It is the future that counts; the future is long." He bought other theaters. He had an orchestra at the Orpheum. He hired live acts, too, and even a little bit of opera. The family moved back to Boston, and in March 1912, Louis Burrill Mayer took American citizenship. He elected to move into distribution, and for $4,000 he got the New England rights to DeMille's <i>The Squaw Man</i>. Then, in 1915, with money acquired from a syndicate, he put up $20,000 to get the New England rights to <i>The Birth of a Nation</i>. For everyone in moving pictures it was the turning point.</p> <p>With Mayer, we are talking about a businessman, albeit one obsessed with the value of content. David Wark Griffith, who conceived of <i>The Birth of a Nation</i>, and made it, deserves to be considered an artist, even if the thing his film gave birth to was more a business than anything else. He was also someone who developed a future technology that would restore the past.</p> <p>Griffith was born on a farm near La Grange, Kentucky, in 1875, the son of man who had fought all through the Civil War for the Confederacy and been wounded twice. David was a country boy, in awe of a father who had difficulty expressing love. He was wistful and dreamy, and in his autobiography he recalled this childhood feeling about media to come: "I have thought what a grand invention it would be if someone could make a magic box in which we could store the precious moments of our lives and keep them with us, and later on, in dark hours, could open this box and receive for at least a few moments, a breath of its stored memory." He was in love with nostalgia, and blind to the astonishing dynamics of the future he helped create.</p> <p>The father died when Griffith was ten, and the family was left poor. The boy grew up tall and handsome, albeit with a soulful expression, and in Louisville he took up acting and singing. He joined a theatrical company; he had parts, and for a few years he was a touring actor--who never seems to have impressed anyone who saw him. He wrote stories, poetry, and plays--one of them, <i>A Fool and a Girl</i>, was produced, and flopped. He applied to the Biograph movie company in New York as an actor, and when they deemed him an unimpressive performer, they asked was he prepared to "direct."</p> <p>In 1908, directing was still a stooge's job. In the mass of very short, sensationalist movies (many of them just ten minutes, few more than twenty), the stress was on getting an adequate camera exposure (catching the light), having enough action (to avoid boredom), showcasing prettiness&nbsp; in its human forms (the embryonic age of stardom), and being wholesome. If you feel there's a contradiction between sensationalism and wholesomeness, don't let any glib argument dissuade you. Without any understanding of how it worked, or where it might go, the medium had let loose the alchemy of the real and of fantasy. A director presided over the shooting, without truly analyzing, let alone controlling it. He called "Action" and "Cut," or their equivalents, and he may have guided the actors. (Sometimes actors did the directing.) But scenarists, actors, and bosses had louder voices, and the cameraman was a small god with a machine no one else understood. A part of us now regards this condition as primitive, or unformed. If film is going to be an art--and some of us have longed for that--don't we need an artist? But time and again over the years the director's authority and glamour have receded. Ask yourself who directed which episode of <i>The Sopranos</i>.</p> <p>In his five years at Biograph, Griffith directed more than four hundred short films, torn between the possibilities of a twentieth-century medium and the sentiments of popular Victorian theater. It's not that he alone invented every fresh way of looking or the grammar of cutting shots together. Mauritz Stiller in Sweden and Louis Feuillade in France were two men working out the same problems, and as creative figures they often seem more interesting now. In a few years, in Russia and Germany, explosive attitudes would change everyone's mind about what this medium could be. But these ideas were not American, and American business power was determining the character of the new show (and promoting America to the rest of the world). Movies had access to the most available and eager crowd, the new city people crying out for escape and amusement.</p> <p>No one worked as much as Griffith; and no one else built a career and let the whole medium ride along on his wagon. Despite his roots in coarse theater, Griffith saw that camera positions could be varied, and made subtle with angle; he divined the power of close-ups in showing what people were feeling and to draw audiences into the suspense; he identified cross-cutting strategies that persist to this day--a way of saying "at the same time" or "meanwhile," so that a story develops. He saw that film stories needed to accelerate, to rise, and to grip more tightly. He made the chase a function of narrative and moral force. He used sets (and he liked them to be accurate to period), but he had a rural eye for real places and natural light. To the modern viewer looking back at the surviving Griffith shorts, the sunlight and the human glance may be the most endearing things.</p> <p>History acclaims him for his big pictures and the establishment of a business. But he was not always at his best with grandiose, epic narratives. He told short stories very well, alert to the interaction of people and place, of ordinary movement and the way we look at each other (the secret in cross-cutting and the way it could lead to inward thoughts, as opposed to feelings put on display). Many of his shorts have a facility and charm that is smothered in the big pictures. So <i>A Corner in Wheat</i> (1909, and only fourteen minutes) is a glimpse of rural life and big-city exploitation. The <i>New York Dramatic Mirror</i> praised Biograph for doing it, and said, "It is another demonstration of the force and power of motion pictures as a means of conveying ideas." But it did not mention Griffith--no one knew enough yet to notice who had delivered the ideas.</p> <p>So the failed actor built a company of players and worked with them so often that they became film actors. Lillian and Dorothy Gish are the best known now, and Griffith was more interested in looking at women than at men, but there were others: Robert Harron, Donald Crisp, Henry B. Walthall, Harry Carey, Blanche Sweet, Mae Marsh, and Mary Pickford. Many of them became stars, but in Griffith's work they seem like supporting players--and in American film that is often a mark of honor. Stars are American, to be sure, but they are not a sign of all men and women being equal. So the fond, respectful regard for "supporting players" may be closer to many American ideals.</p> <p>In his quiet but firm way, Griffith educated actors. Lillian Gish (his greatest project, his model, and perhaps his goddess) once called films "flickers" in his hearing, and Mr. Griffith, as she spoke of him, told her, "Never let me hear that word again in this studio. Just remember, you're no longer working in some second-rate theatrical company. What we do here will be seen tomorrow by people all over America--people all over the world."</p> <p>We know he was right, but his earnestness was driven by hope and his own memories of failure in second-rate theatricals. So in 1913, Griffith left Biograph and began to make longer films: <i>Judith of Bethulia</i> was an hour long, and terribly archaic in its biblical material and attitudes. He felt challenged by feature-length films coming from Italy and France--ornate costume dramas fixed on re-creating the past and throwing spectacle at the audience. Given a machine that would shape the future, many early filmmakers elected to revive the past--so Griffith dreamed of a remade Civil War.</p> <p>His best biographer, Richard Schickel, has observed that, despite Griffith preparing to change the world, he was unworldly to a degree. He knew next to nothing about the latest steps in literature, music, or painting. And his pioneering looks nearly chi...</p></p><h2>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Legendary Standard Edition: Prima Official Game Guide</h2><p>What's Included?

Indeed, it was the second in what became Hansen's series of Southern California-set whodunits featuring insurance-claims investigator Dave Brandstetter, who is not without his own lost loves and private demons--and yet never without his cigarette, glass of whiskey (neat, of course), and enough terse, manly stoicism to make Steve McQueen look like Richard Simmons. The Brandstetter series has acquired something of a cult following over the 30 years that Hansen developed it (<i>Death Claims</i> is the second title in its U.S. revival courtesy of Alyson Publications, although many more are currently in print by No Exit Press, available on Amazon's U.K. link) and this slim, no-slack volume, which followed up <i>Fadeout</i>, the series debut, makes it delightfully clear why. Everything you could want in a gay-inflected murder mystery set in golden-haired SoCal in the Nixon years is here: A middle-aged rare-books dealer whose doped-up body is found washed up on the coast, his shrewish ex-wife, his lovely young bibliophile girlfriend, and his angelically beautiful and adoring actor son. Don't forget the imperiously queeny head of the local repertory theater; the confirmed-bachelor superstar of a TV western and the blind, Bible-thumping mother who rules his life; a seedy young hospital orderly who smuggles morphine to addicted patients; and a couple of small-time academics obsessed with the lost notebooks of Thomas Wolfe.<p> Then there's Hansen's language, which falls brilliantly somewhere between homage to and spoof of his thriller-penning forebears, right from the first line--"Arena Blanca was right. The sand that bracketed the little bay was so white it hurt the eyes...gulls sheared a sky cheerful as new denim"--to curt, epigrammatic lines--"The dead are terrible. They won't help you at all. No matter how you loved them"--that can only be said with a cigarette propped out of the corner of one's mouth. In fact, the only thing you could call even remotely stereotypically gay about Hansen's prose (or, indeed, Brandstetter's point-of-view) is its obsession with interior design--but even that remains true to genre ("a wastebasket was alone there like a dwarf prince in a dungeon--royal-purple plastic embossed with gold fleur-de-lis..."). </p><p> True, none of the supporting characters is really developed beyond colorful stock, and not every gear of the story clicks into place with the elegant exactitude and ever-increasing tension and claustrophobia of the technically perfect mystery novel. But who cares? Dave Brandstetter is too cool to be passed up. He's got a steady enough hand to take a drink with even the most sinister of suspects, he hangs out and talks about relationships with his suave Lothario dad, and he can be sensitive and tender with his longtime lesbian friend Madge without lapsing into total schmaltz. Oh, and of course he's haunted by the boy that got away. <i>--Timothy Murphy</i></p>Joseph Hansen is the author of more than 25 novels and is a renowned short story writer.

Kirkpatrick, who converted to Islam and, after a celebrated and notorious romance, married Khair un-Nissa, the teenage great-niece of the region's prime minister, exemplifies the "White Mughals," British colonialists who "went native." One of the book's strengths is its stunningly detailed depiction of day-to-day life-gardens, food, sexual mores, modes of travel and architecture-and portraits of British governors-general, Indian politicians, their wives and families, and adventurers. It is also an astute study of the political complications Kirkpatrick faced because of his conversion and cross-cultural marriage, and the difficulties his divided loyalties caused him in his role as agent of the increasingly imperialistic British. But most suspenseful is the fate of Kirkpatrick's willful and charismatic wife, just 19 when he died in 1805, and the fate of their children. The twists and turns in the life of their daughter-sent to England when she was five, never to return to India or see her mother again-are fascinating. Dalrymple makes note of the present schism, which some believe unbridgeable, between Western and Eastern civilizations and Kirkpatrick's tale as a counterexample that the two can meet.

Six years after the Battle of Endor, the Empire has been reborn, guided by a mysterious new leader. With a price on their heads, our heroes are on the run. Han and Leia struggle to protect their unborn child from the bounty hunters and Imperial troops that dog their steps. But their greatest danger may lie in the troubled heart of a hero&#x2014;as Luke succumbs to the lure of the dark side!</p><p>Tom Veitch's original comic strip story traces Luke Skywalker's entrance into the Dark Side in the years after the fall of Darth Vader. The Empire is fragmented, and the Rebels seem on the verge of winning their long struggle when the sinister power of World Devastators emerges from the galactic core. These Devastators chew up worlds and manufacture robotic war machines out of the resources they consume. Luke's dark journey seems the only way to halt the massacre. But despite the importance of Luke in <i>Dark Empire</i>, the portrayal of Leia as an emerging Jedi is really the centerpiece of this volume. Married to Han (who goes flat in Veitch's hands) and with two children, Leia is torn between her role as mother and her role as Jedi warrior. While the story sometimes jumps too quickly between major scenes, Veitch does a good job of capturing the epic feel of George Lucas's masterpiece trilogy. Cam Kennedy's artwork is mixed in quality. Some of his drawings of the Millennium Falcon, hunter-killer probes, and robotic TIE-fighters seem to leap directly from the movie screen, while his human figures (especially of Han and Luke) can appear generic. Also, his style of coloring, using washes of similar colors on each page, is good for capturing moods but tends to obscure details. Despite these occasional shortcoming, this comic is recommended for one simple reason: once you start reading it, you won't be able to put it down. The other two parts of the <i>Dark Empire</i> trilogy include: <i>Dark Empire II</i> and <i>Empire's End</i>. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i>Coming soon...</p><h2>Over the Edge: Fred Harvey at the Grand Canyon and in the Great Southwest</h2><p>As we know them today, the American Southwest, and the Grand Canyon that lies at its heart, are the product of vast natural forces over millions of years.

A self-described research junkie, she has parlayed her interest in police procedure, cutting edge forensics, and twisted plots into a streak of 11 bestselling suspense novels, including her most recent release, <em> The Neighbor</em>. Read her guest review of <i>Still Missing</i>:</b> <br> <p> </p><p> Heading to a beach? Boy do I have the book for you! </p> <p> Every now and then a new author comes along that totally knocks one out of the park. As a reader, I&#x2019;m always thrilled to discover a great new voice. As a writer, of course I&#x2019;m insanely jealous and suffer a terrible case of why-didn&#x2019;t-I-think-of-that? Given that debut author Chevy Stevens is young, beautiful and talented, I&#x2019;ve been gnashing my teeth for months! </p> <p> <i>Still Missing</i> represents psychological suspense at its very best. Realtor Annie O&#x2019;Sullivan is abducted from an open house and held captive for a year in a remote cabin by a sadistic survivalist who considers her to be his wife as well as preferred breeding stock. His goal is to get her pregnant and live creepily-ever-after as the last man and woman on earth. Her goal is to get away from him. </p> <p> Now, you know Annie wins this war as the book opens with her talking to a therapist. So you may ask, where is the suspense? I can&#x2019;t give you a simple answer to that, other than to say every page crackles with it. </p> <p> <i>Still Missing</i> creates one of the most haunting narratives I&#x2019;ve read in years. On the one hand, survivor Annie is tough, angry, and brittle. The very worst has happened to her, and she escaped through her own ingenuity and frankly, savagery. On the other hand, survivor Annie is jumpy, terrified, and sleep-deprived. All these months later, she still can&#x2019;t pee &#x201c;off schedule.&#x201d; In one of the more moving scenes of the novel, she downs a gallon of iced tea in order to force herself to urinate by her own free will. She can&#x2019;t do it. </p> <p> In addition to her compelling heroine, Stevens has created one of the best psychopaths since Hannibal Lecter&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s not something I say lightly. Annie refers to her captor simply as The Freak. Much like Hannibal, The Freak considers himself to be a civilized human being. Intelligent, good looking and resourceful, he&#x2019;s an excellent &#x201c;husband.&#x201d; He has provided a charming cabin. He supplies fresh food&#x2014;sometimes so fresh that city slicker Annie must bleed it out first, but details, details. Of course he has expectations of his wife. She must be well groomed, properly garbed, and 100% submissive. All failures to comply are met with The Freak&#x2019;s idea of appropriate punishment. The Freak is also thoughtful and tender. Want to stop sleeping for a few nights? Read the scene where The Freak first shaves Annie. And he means it in the nicest sort of way. </p> <p> Stevens skillfully juxtaposes the back story of Annie&#x2019;s captivity with the front story of a woman desperately trying to reclaim her old life. As with all great suspense novels, the surprises abound. Annie thought she&#x2019;d survived the worst with The Freak. But has she? </p> <p> As the taut cat and mouse game unfolds, you will cheer for Annie. You will hate The Freak. And you will be absolutely mesmerized by the last line of this novel. Then, most likely, you will return to page one, and start it all over again. </p> <p>So give yourself a summer vacation.

One day as he was standing guard at the gate, there came a tiny man wearing a golden cat and carrying a sack of gold on his shoulders.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d; the poor brother asked.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m your brother&#x2019;s luck.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The poor brother was amazed. &#x201c;Perhaps you can tell me where I can find <i>my </i>luck?&#x201d; he said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Of course I can, but it won&#x2019;t do you any good,&#x201d; said the tiny man. &#x201c;Because he&#x2019;s lying in a deserted field that&#x2019;s hard to find. And your luck is mangy and run down and asleep.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>But the poor brother begged and pleased and wept, until finally the man took pity on him. &#x201c;All right then, I&#x2019;ll tell you,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Go off that way for a long, long time till you come to a field. Go past it for a long time till you come to another field, where you&#x2019;ll see thousands of lucks lying asleep. Don&#x2019;t wake them. Go on until you see thousands of other lucks who have just woken up. They will be sitting around yawning and scratching themselves, but don&#x2019;t let that bother you. Keep going, keep searching until you find a luck who&#x2019;s sleeping sounder than the others, and snoring louder. That one is your luck.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>And when the little man with the gold cap had finished speaking, he disappeared.<br>&nbsp;<br>Early the next morning the poor brother started off in search of his luck. He walked on and on until he came to a barren field, just as the little man had said. He didn&#x2019;t stop but went on until he came to another field that was equally barren. He looked about and saw a great many lucks sleeping and snoring, but he did not disturb them. He saw others who sat around yawning and scratching themselves, but he paid no attention.<br>&nbsp;<br>He went on and one, searching and searching, until he saw a luck That was sleeping more deeply than the others. He went up and tried to wake him: &#x201c;Luck, my luck, wake up. Why do you sleep so hard?&#x201d; His luck never stirred, just slept and snored. Again he tried to wake him, but nothing helped. Finally the poor man wept. &#x201c;Luck, ah my luck,&#x201d; he pleaded, &#x201c;don&#x2019;t sleep anymore. Pay attention. My wife and children are hungry. Help me. Give me something.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>His luck said nothing.

The king signed the decree and gave it to them, but then the dogs couldn&#x2019;t think of a place to put it.

The lions snoozed all day long, the elephants enjoyed their baths, and the zebras ate their hay in piece- all because Helen was spinning her web catching flies. But one day Helen&#39;s webs were swept away. The Keeper had the cages cleaned for the Mayer&#39;s inspection tour. Soon the flies were back again and the animals were miserable once more. But not for long... Children will be fascinated and amused by the way Helen solved the problem and won a permanent place of honor for herself in the Zoo.Gene Zion and two-time Caldecott Honor winner Margaret Bloy Graham have collaborated on several favorite stories about Harry: <em>Harry by the Sea, Harry the Dirty Dog,</em> and <em>No Roses for Harry</em>.</p><h2>The Two Pillars</h2><p>S.C. Biela presents and examines two of the most fundamental aspects of interior life: Contrition and gratitude. He insightfully likens contrition and gratitude to two spiritual pillars in unexpected, thought-provoking ways. Additionally, Biela reminds us of the special gift and role of the Blessed Mother as God&#39;s instrument who assists the individual in growing in the authentic contrition and gratitude necessary when following the path to sanctity.</p><p>Slawomir Cezary Biela was born in Poland in 1956. He studied at the Warsaw University of Technology, where he earned his Doctorate in Physics. He also studied at the Papal Faculty of Theology in Warsaw, especially in the field of the Theology of Spirituality. It is worth noting that Biela's books have been published in the following countries: USA&lt; Canada, Great Britain, Ireland, the Philippines, Kenya, South Korea, Spain (in Spanish and Catalan), Mexico, Portugal, Brazil, Italy, France, Holland, Lithuania, Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, Byelorussia (in Russian and Byelorussian). As of this printing, translations are being prepared in the following languages: German, Latvian, Hungarian, Slovak, and Vietnamese. The Two Pillars presents the same spirituality as the worldwide best-seller Inquiring Faith (known in the USA as The Gift of Faith), by Rev. Tadeusz Dajczer. The Gift of Faith is translated into nearly forty languages.The Two Pillars was an amazing read for me. I never realized how foundational these two virtues [contrition and gratitude] are to the spiritual life. The simplicity and beauty of this approach was truly refreshing to read, and gave me a clear path to deeper intimacy with God the Father. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is seeking to understand the secrets of personal holiness. --Martin Doman, Musician, founder of Christ Music<br><br>S. C. Biela's latest book is a welcome addition to the Christian tradition of spiritual literature. The central themes of Gratitude and Contrition are contemplated in a way as to help the reader to counter-challenge a culture of prideful entitlement, of a loss of the sense for sin, and of coldness of hearts.

But to those at some remove in time or distance, the catalog often represents their only contact with the exhibit and must stand as a marker of the scholarship invested in it and a visual testament of the objects displayed. To deal with these differing and conflicting roles, the exhibition of imperial treasures from China currently touring this country has two catalogs of differing length and scope. After introducing each historical period, Splendors of Imperial China highlights 107 of the 475 artworks in the exhibition and gives a short analysis of the works. Smaller ceramic and bronze pieces are shown in full, as are some painted works, but many large scrolls are shown only in detail. These details lose the larger perspective vital to understanding such wall-spanning scrolls as Huai-su's "Autobiographical Essay," a purely calligraphic portrait that progresses from small, tight characters to marvelous looping, flying ones as the painter drinks more and more wine. Possessing the Past is the inclusive scholarly text illustrating all 475 artworks. Clearly intended to have lasting value and to present in-depth information on thousands of years of Chinese art history, it lacks some of the graphic verve of Splendors. Both volumes are slightly marred by some poorly reproduced images. Splendors of Imperial China will suit general readers seeking a visual introduction to classical Chinese art, while Possessing the Past will anchor academic art history collections.?David McClelland, formerly with Temple Univ., Philadelphia<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.More than an exhibition catalogue, this breathtakingly beautiful volume, a major work of scholarship, offers a panoramic history of Chinese art and culture. Its 436 color plates and 190 halftones reproduce hundreds of masterpieces from the Chinese Palace Museum in Taiwan?artworks that originally constituted the personal collection of 18th-century Emperor Ch'ien-lung, and were transported out of communist China to Taipei after WWII. Among the treasures are eighth-century calligraphic brush masterpieces, monumental landscape hanging scrolls of the Northern Sung (10th-11th centuries), elegant porcelain, naturalistic flower, bird and animal paintings, and life-size, robust imperial portraits. Essays by Chinese and Western art historians sweep from the Neolithic Age's magical and religious uses of jade (third millennium B.C.) to Bronze Age rituals, the paradoxical rejuvenation of art under the Mongol conquest, Buddhist and Taoist influences, Ming scholar-artists' revolt against orthodoxy and 17th-century Ch'ing emperors' use of the arts as tools for glorification of the state. The exhibition opened at New York's Metropolitan Museum and will tour nationally.

His articles have appeared in leading newspapers and journals throughout the world. He lives in London.PROLOGUE<br><br>Wednesday 19 July 2000 was the day chosen for the pageant celebrating the hundredth birthday of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. In London, the day did not begin well. There were bomb scares, the controlled explosion of a suspicious bag, and many trains were cancelled. Senior police officers considered whether the whole event should be abandoned. It was not. <br><br>The celebration, on Horse Guards Parade in Whitehall, had been designed as a joyful tribute to Queen Elizabeth and the hundreds of organizations with which she was connected. In warm afternoon sunshine, as the National Anthem was performed by massed military bands, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and a choir of a thousand singers, Queen Elizabeth, dressed in pink, arrived with her grandson the Prince of Wales in a landau escorted by the Household Cavalry.<br><br>After she had inspected the troops, she and the Prince sat on a flower-bedecked dais (though she stood much of the time) to watch the parade together. It began with a march-past of the regiments of which she was colonel-in-chief, followed by the King&#x2019;s Troop of the Royal Horse Artillery and the Mounted Bands of the Household Cavalry. One hundred homing doves were released as a young boy sang &#x2018;Oh for the Wings of a Dove&#x2019;.<br><br>Then came a cavalcade of the century, a light-hearted look at the hundred years she had lived through; more of a circus than a parade, it included 450 children and adults, with a variety of stars. Among the scenes and players who passed in front of her were soldiers of the First World War, ballroom dancers from the 1920s, a Second World War fire engine and ambulance, Pearly Kings and Queens from the East End of London, and people in 1940s dress celebrating victory in 1945.<br><br>Then came a series of post-war cars &#x2013; Enid Blyton&#x2019;s Noddy in his yellow car, the first Mini Minor, James Bond&#x2019;s Aston Martin, an E-type Jaguar. More recent &#x2013; and perhaps more surprising &#x2013; twentieth-century memories were recalled by Hell&#x2019;s Angels on their bikes, punk-rock youths in black and the television characters, the Wombles.<br><br>After this eclectic depiction of the previous ten decades, representatives of 170 of the more than 300 civil organizations, charities and other groups with which Queen Elizabeth was associated marched past her. This part of the parade began with Queen Elizabeth&#x2019;s page leading two of her corgis, the breed of dog which had for so long shared her life. There were more animals: camels (ridden by members of the Worshipful Company of Grocers, whose emblem is a camel), horses, an Aberdeen Angus bull, North Country Cheviot sheep, chickens, racehorses. The groups waving gaily as they passed included the Girls&#x2019; Brigade, Queen Elizabeth&#x2019;s Overseas Nursing Services Association, the Cookery and Food Association (a hundred chefs all in their whites), the&nbsp; Mothers&#x2019; Union, the Poultry Club of Great Britain, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, the National Trust, the Royal College of Midwives, St John Ambulance Brigade, the Royal School of Needlework, the Colditz Association, the Battle of Britain Fighter Association, the Bomber Command Association and, bringing up the rear, twenty-two holders of the Victoria and George Crosses, Britain&#x2019;s highest awards for heroism, followed by the venerable Chelsea Pensioners marching stiffly but proudly in their bright red uniforms. Everyone in the stands stood up as these brave men and women passed.<br><br>RAF planes from the Second World War &#x2013; a Spitfire, a Hurricane, a Lancaster bomber, a Bristol Blenheim &#x2013; flew overhead, followed by the Red Arrows trailing red, white and blue vapour trails. And all the while the bands and the orchestra played on and the choirs sang. Hubert Parry&#x2019;s glorious anthem &#x2018;I Was Glad&#x2019;, which had been sung at King George VI and Queen Elizabeth&#x2019;s Coronation in 1937, was followed by First World War music-hall favourites such as &#x2018;Pack Up Your Troubles in Your Old Kit Bag&#x2019;, &#x2018;Keep the Home Fires Burning&#x2019; and (nicely vulgar) &#x2018;My Old Man Said Follow the Van&#x2019;. Three hundred children from the Chicken Shed Company danced. Altogether some 2,000 military personnel and more than 5,000 civilians celebrated on Horse Guards Parade.<br><br>The whole event lasted an hour and a half, and at the end the Queen Mother made a short speech of thanks saying it had been a<br>wonderful afternoon and &#x2018;a great joy to me&#x2019;. The crowd cheered, the National Anthem was sung again, and Queen Elizabeth got into her car to make a lap of honour past thousands of happy, cheering people before driving off to St James&#x2019;s Palace, where she climbed the stairs to the State Rooms and spent the next hour and a half at a reception, sitting down only to talk to the singer Dame Vera Lynn. <br><br>Two weeks later, on the morning of her actual hundredth birthday, 4 August, a large crowd gathered outside her London home, Clarence House. The gates were opened and Queen Elizabeth came out to take the salute when the King&#x2019;s Troop, the Royal Horse Artillery, marched past. In front of the crowd the royal postman, Tony Nicholls, delivered her the traditional message sent by the Queen to all her subjects who reach their hundredth birthday. The Queen Mother started to open it and then passed it to her equerry. &#x2018;Come on, use your sword,&#x2019; she said. Captain William de Rouet unsheathed his ceremonial blade and slit the envelope open. The message was written in the Queen&#x2019;s own hand and read, &#x2018;On your 100th birthday all the family join with me in<br>sending you our loving best wishes for this special day. Lilibet&#x2019;.1 Then, with the Prince of Wales, Queen Elizabeth climbed into a<br>landau decked with flowers in her racing colours of blue and gold, and was driven to Buckingham Palace past the large crowds lining the Mall. The Prince was deeply moved by the rapturous reception for his beloved grandmother. It was, he thought, &#x2018;the British at their best &#x2013; and you always manage to bring the best out in people!&#x2019;2&nbsp; At the Palace, Queen Elizabeth appeared alone on the balcony. She waved to the crowds as she had first waved after her marriage in 1923 and, most famously, on Victory in Europe (VE) Day in May 1945. As the Band of the Coldstream Guards played Happy Birthday and the crowd roared its approval, she was joined by twenty-seven of her children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, nephews, nieces and many of their spouses.<br><br>In her long life the world had undergone technological change with unprecedented speed, and political transformations of exceptional violence. It had moved from the age of travel by horse to that of travel through space. The First World War and the Russian Revolution had toppled the emperors of Austria, Germany and Russia. Many other European kings and queens had subsequently departed their thrones. The United Kingdom had suffered the trauma of the Great War and then faced almost continuous challenge from economic and political turmoil, from war and the threat of war &#x2013; through a world slump, the<br>abdication of King Edward VIII, the Second World War, the Cold War. Queen Elizabeth had come to terms with massive changes &#x2013; loss of empire, the growth of a modern multi-racial Commonwealth of newly independent states in Asia and Africa, and a social revolution in Britain itself which had begun with the first majority Labour government elected in 1945.<br><br>The British monarchy was not isolated from the political and social changes. Indeed the abdication in 1936 was a self-inflicted wound from which it might not have recovered. It had adapted itself, and it had survived; more than that, it had retained the consent of the people essential to constitutional monarchy. This adaptation was largely due to the efforts of successive sovereigns and their advisers. But a key question, explored in this book, is the extent to which the consent necessary for its survival was generated by the woman who was for almost eighty years at its heart &#x2013; as Duchess of York, Queen and Queen Mother.<br><br>In any biography of a public person there is a danger of overemphasizing the role of the individual in shaping events. This is particularly true when the individual has, like Queen Elizabeth, great prestige but no real power. Nevertheless, it remains legitimate to ask how Queen Elizabeth responded to the great personal and public crises of her life and what wider effect this had.<br><br>How did she do it? What combination of qualities had enabled this young Scottish aristocrat to come into the Royal Family and play such a central role in the life of the nation for almost eighty years? What part did she play in her unique family, as a young married woman, as a mother, as grandmother and great-grandmother? And on the national stage, how did she earn and, more remarkably, how did she retain her popularity through all of the turbulent twentieth century? What were the drawbacks to her very particular style? What did she really contribute to the monarchy and to the nation in times of crisis and social revolution? Would the British monarchy have evolved in a very different way without her influence? And would that have helped or hindered the institution and the country? All these questions can perhaps be examined in the context of a few words from Walter Bagehot, the mid-nineteenth-century writer who is often seen as the greatest interpreter of modern monarchy: &#x2018;The nation is divided into parties, but the crown is of no party. Its apparent separation from business is that which removes it both from enmities and from desecration, which preserves its mystery, which enables it to combine the affection of conflicting parties &#x2013; to be a visible symbol of unity.&#x2019;</p><h2>The Book of J</h2><p>Scholars agree that the first strand in Genesis, Exodus, and Numbers was written by an author whom they call J, who lived in the tenth century before Christ.<br><br>In The Book of J, accompanying David Rosenberg's startling new translation, America's greatest literary critic, Harold Bloom, asserts that J was a writer of the stature of Homer, Shakespeare, and Tolstoy and puts forth the revolutionary idea that J was very likely a woman.<br><br>J was a genius with unmatched powers of irony and characterization, as shown in her unforgettable and very human portraits of Abram and Sarai, Rebecca, Jacob and Rachel, Joseph, Tamar, and Moses -- and, above all, God, or Yahweh.

Though Verdy varies her tone to suit the flavor of each dance, and while her narrative style is clear, it's not especially distinguished; what's special here is that the author's retellings are actually careful explications of the dancers' movements, making them excellent sources for anyone seeing the ballet. Brief introductions give each ballet's history and Verdy's personal experience with it. The splendid Marcia Brown (three Caldecotts plus three Honors) contributes three or four full-page, mixed-media (watercolor, pastel, pencil) illustrations for each ballet. Classical in feeling, they represent the characters as dancers, exquisitely capturing their movement and grace; the backgrounds are appropriately theatrical and impressionistic, the compositions dynamic yet skillfully balanced, the use of color adroit and sometimes daringly imaginative. A fine addition to any collection. (Nonfiction. 5+) -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Grade 3-6-- Although there are a number of retellings (both in and out of print) of the most frequently performed ballets, this collection by a former principal ballerina captures the tone and character of each dance. For example, the great "white" ballets, Giselle and Swan Lake , are told in the romantic tradition. Coppelia is given a more lighthearted and matter-of-fact treatment. The notes that precede each of the tales are most interesting for their history and insights. Brown's paintings, done in watercolor, pastel, and pencil, dress the pages with sets and costumes that readers might experience in live performances. Each story has three or four illustrations, not always well-placed, that depict the high points. One cavil--the fourth prince described in the text is missing from the scene of Aurora's birthday ball in Sleeping Beauty . This collection, which also includes The Firebird and The Nutcracker , will serve as a good written and visual introduction to six staples of the classical repertoire. --Amy Kellman, Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Invention of Air</h2><p><b>Bestselling author Steven Johnson recounts&#x2014;in dazzling, multidisciplinary fashion&#x2014;the story of the brilliant man who embodied the relationship between science, religion, and politics for America&#x2019;s Founding Fathers</b>.<br><br> <i>The Invention of Air</i> is a book of world-changing ideas wrapped around a compelling narrative, a story of genius and violence and friendship in the midst of sweeping historical change that provokes us to recast our understanding of the Founding Fathers.<br><br> It is the story of Joseph Priestley&#x2014;scientist and theologian, prot�g� of Benjamin Franklin, friend of Thomas Jefferson&#x2014;an eighteenth-century radical thinker who played pivotal roles in the invention of ecosystem science, the discovery of oxygen, the founding of the Unitarian Church, and the intellectual development of the United States. And it is a story that only Steven Johnson, acclaimed juggler of disciplines and provocative ideas, can do justice to.<br><br> In the 1780s, Priestley had established himself in his native England as a brilliant scientist, a prominent minister, and an outspoken advocate of the American Revolution, who had sustained long correspondences with Franklin, Jefferson, and John Adams. Ultimately, his radicalism made his life politically uncomfortable, and he fled to the nascent United States. Here, he was able to build conceptual bridges linking the scientific, political, and religious impulses that governed his life. And through his close relationships with the Founding Fathers&#x2014;Jefferson credited Priestley as the man who prevented him from abandoning Christianity&#x2014;he exerted profound if little-known influence on the shape and course of our history.<br><br> As in his last bestselling work, <i>The Ghost Map</i>, Steven Johnson here uses a dramatic historical story to explore themes that have long engaged him: innovation and the way new ideas emerge and spread, and the environments that foster these breakthroughs. And as he did in <i>Everything Bad Is Good for You</i>, Johnson upsets some fundamental assumptions about the world we live in&#x2014;namely, what it means when we invoke the Founding Fathers&#x2014;and replaces them with a clear-eyed, eloquent assessment of where we stand today.</p><p>Steven Johnson is the author of the national bestsellers <i>Everything Bad Is Good for You</i> and <i>Mind Wide Open: Your Brain and the Neuroscience of Everyday Life</i>, as well as <i>Emergence: The Connected Lives of Ants, Brains, Cities, and Software</i> and <i>Interface Culture: How New Technology Transforms the Way We Create and Communicate</i>.<p>Table of Contents</p><p>Title Page</p><p>Copyright Page</p><p>Dedication</p><p>Epigraph</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>CHAPTER ONE - The Electricians</p><p>CHAPTER TWO - Rose and Nightshade</p><p>CHAPTER THREE - Intermezzo: An Island of Coal</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR - The Wild Gas</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE - A Comet in the System</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>Acknowledgements</p><p>NOTES</p><p>BIBLIOGRAPHY</p><p>ALSO BY STEVEN JOHNSON</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><i>Interface Culture:</i> <br><i>How New Technology Transforms the Way We Create and Communicate</i></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><i>Emergence:</i> <br><i>The Connected Lives of Ants, Brains, Cities, and Software</i></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><i>Mind Wide Open:</i> <br><i>Your Brain and the Neuroscience of Everyday Life</i></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><i>Everything Bad Is Good for You:</i> <br><i>How Today&#x2019;s Popular Culture Is Actually Making Us Smarter</i></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><i>The Ghost Map:</i> <br><i>The Story of London&#x2019;s Most Terrifying Epidemic&#x2014;and How It Changed</i> <br><i>Science, Cities, and the Modern World</i></p><p>RIVERHEAD BOOKS</p><p>a member of Penguin Group (USA) Inc.</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p> <br><i>New York</i> <br>2008<p></p><p>RIVERHEAD BOOKS</p><p>Published by the Penguin Group</p><p>Penguin Group (USA) Inc., 375 Hudson Street, New York, New York 10014, USA Penguin Group (Canada), 90 Eglinton Avenue East, Suite 700, Toronto, Ontario M4P 2Y3, Canada (a division of Pearson Canada Inc.)

He shrugged off the question with a dismissive jab of humor. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s interesting that that question would even be asked of someone running for president,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not planning on writing the curriculum for an eighth-grade science book. I&#x2019;m asking for the opportunity to be president of the United States.&#x201d;</p><p>It was a funny line, but the joke only worked in a specific intellectual context. For the statement to make sense, the speaker had to share one basic assumption with his audience: that &#x201c;science&#x201d; was some kind of specialized intellectual field, about which political leaders needn&#x2019;t know anything to do their business. Imagine a candidate dismissing a question about his foreign policy experience by saying he was running for president and not writing a textbook on international affairs. The joke wouldn&#x2019;t make sense, because we assume that foreign policy expertise is a central qualification for the chief executive. But science? That&#x2019;s for the guys in lab coats.</p><p>That line has stayed with me since, because the web of events at the center of this book suggests that its basic assumptions are fundamentally flawed. If there is an overarching moral to this story, it is that vital fields of intellectual achievement cannot be cordoned off from one another and relegated to the specialists, that politics can and should be usefully informed by the insights of science. The protagonists of this story lived in a climate where ideas flowed easily between the realms of politics, philosophy, religion, and science. The closest thing to a hero in this book&#x2014;the chemist, theologian, and political theorist Joseph Priestley&#x2014;spent his whole career in the space that connects those different fields. But the other figures central to this story&#x2014;Ben Franklin, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson&#x2014;suggest one additional reading of the &#x201c;eighth-grade science&#x201d; remark. It was anti-intellectual, to be sure, but it was something even more incendiary in the context of a presidential race. It was positively un-American.</p><p>In their legendary thirteen-year final correspondence, reflecting back on their collaborations and their feuds, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams wrote 165 letters to each other. In that corpus, Benjamin Franklin is mentioned by name five times, while George Washington is mentioned three times. Their mutual nemesis Alexander Hamilton warrants only two references. By contrast, Priestley, an Englishman who spent only the last decade of his life in the United States, is mentioned fifty-two times. That statistic alone gives some sense of how important Priestley was to the founders, in part because he would play a defining role in the rift and ultimate reconciliation between Jefferson and Adams, and in part because his distinctive worldview had a profound impact on both men, just as it had on Franklin three decades before. Yet today, Priestley is barely more than a footnote in most popular accounts of the revolutionary generation. This book is an attempt to understand how Priestley became so central to the great minds of this period&#x2014;in the fledgling United States, but also in England and France. It is not so much a biography as it is the biography of one man&#x2019;s ideas, the links of association and influence that connect him to epic changes in science, belief, and society&#x2014;as well as to some of the darkest episodes of mob violence and political repression in the history of Britain and the United States.</p></p><h2>I Already Know I Love You</h2><p><p>Based on the author's own experience, <i>I Already Know I Love You</i> describes the cavalcade of feelings that comes with being a grandfather for the very first time. Beginning with anticipating the new baby's arrival, this book celebrates all the moments, great and small, that a new grandpa is ready to share. Whether it's taking a nap together or rooting for the Yankees, this grandpa just can't wait. Lush and dreamy pastels complement the heartfelt text, and together they celebrate all the joy a brand-new baby brings to the world.</p></p><p>Comedian, actor, and director Billy Crystal&#x2019;s ode to his first grandchild will strike a chord with every expectant grandparent (and parents, too). Readers will feel the sweet anticipation building as Grandpa Crystal dreams about the baby&#x2019;s upcoming birth. While the writing is at times awkward, the sentiment behind the text is genuine and universal, " I want to feel your heart beat as you lie upon my chest, bait your hook, fly your kite, help you study for a test." The narrator envisions peekaboo, horsey, and visits to the beach with a red-haired tot--his love virtually bubbles over. Pastel illustrations (reminiscent of the dreamy, soft-focus drawings in pregnancy books) by Elizabeth Sayles show the rugged, gray-haired gramps beaming as he partakes of the imagined pleasures to come. Crystal concludes with another awkward yet heartfelt verse:<blockquote>Your mom is my daughter, and your dad is his mom&#x2019;s son. You lived within your mommy, but now the time has come. Get ready, sweet little one-- Your life will be just great. I&#x2019;m going to be your grandpa, and... I can hardly wait.</blockquote> (All Ages) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i><p>Tony Award-winning comedian, director, actor, and author Billy Crystal is just as importantly a grandfather.

In the phar�maceutical industry, it&#x2019;s Merck. In discount retail, it&#x2019;s Family Dollar. It used to be Wrig�ley in candy and Maytag in appliances. Other superstars have been hidden in plain sight, like Heartland Express in trucking or Linear Technology in semiconductors. How do these exceptional companies deliver superior perfor�mance over the long run despite facing the same constraints as competitors? What are they doing differently? What can we learn from them?<br>&nbsp;<br>Michael E. Raynor and Mumtaz Ahmed have analyzed data on more than 25,000 com�panies spanning forty-five years. Their five-year study began with a sophisticated statistical analysis to identify which companies have truly exceptional performance, 344 in all.<br>&nbsp;<br>In collaboration with teams of researchers, Raynor and Ahmed then put a carefully chosen representative sample of twenty-seven com�panies under the microscope to uncover what made the stand-out performers different. They found that exceptional companies, when faced with difficult decisions, follow three rules:<br><ol><li>Better before cheaper. They rarely compete on price.</li><li>Revenue before cost. They drive profits through price and volume, not thrift.</li><li>There are no other rules. Everything else is up for grabs, and they are willing to change anything to remain true to the first two rules.</li></ol>&nbsp;<br>The rules provide an indispensable compass that any company can use to chart its own path to greatness. Is it better to keep price down or invest in creating value that commands a higher price? Should you focus on talent and develop�ing the abilities of your people or build processes to extend the capabilities of your organization? How about acquiring a sizable competitor to secure economies of scale&#x2014;or a small start-up to gain access to new technology? According to Raynor and Ahmed, the right answers to these and just about every other question are the ones most closely aligned with the rules.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>The Three Rules </i>is built on a powerful combina�tion of large-scale data analysis and in-depth case studies. Its guidance will increase the chance that your organization can become truly exceptional.</p><p><b>MICHAEL E.

How much of corporate success is due to random good luck or to good planning and execution that can be passed along to help other companies? Raynor and Ahmed analyzed performance data on more than 25,000 companies from 1966 to 2010 to uncover the essential elements of high corporate achievement. After settling on 344 exceptional companies, they explored those factors that set the exceptional apart from all others in industries as varied as semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and confectionary. Looking beyond regulation, competition, and myriad other factors, they boiled down success to three rules: better before cheaper, revenue before cost, and don&#x2019;t get distracted by anything other than the first two rules. Among the exceptional performers are Merck in pharmaceuticals, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch in retail, and Maytag in appliances, each described in excruciating detail to explain how it outperforms competitors. But beyond the tables, charts, and statistics lies a book written in very accessible language and with a simplicity of focus on the basics that can apply to any sector and any business. --Vanessa Bush</p><h2>The Cold Way Home: A Novel (Bell Elkins Novels, 8)</h2><p><p><b>"[An] emotion-charged mystery....

So begins the story.<br>The man explains how each piece moves, and why. For example, the king is all-powerful, so he can move in any direction. But because a ruler must be cautious, he can move only one square per turn. he animosity of the kings is so great that they can never occupy adjacent squares, and their importance is such that if a side loses its king, it has lost the war. Each piece is given similar treatment, as are such moves as check, checkmate, castling, and en passant. The highly individualistic illustrations help demonstrate the mechanics of the game explained in the text, and a more conventional board-and -piece icon on each page show that more literal interpretation of the move. Through an illustrated story of the creation of chess, this book provides narratives and visual devices for learning the game and remembering the moves.<br> <i>The Story of Chess</i> will excite and teach children new to the game and will emphasize each piece's importance for those already familiar with the rules.</p><p>Grade 3-6-An imagined retelling of the origins of chess. The narrator traces the game to, "a great island that has since disappeared." (In truth, its roots lie arguably in either India or China and it developed through Europe until it came to be the game we know today.) The story is about the leaders of two warring nations who, after suffering great losses battling one another, wish to leave a tribute so that such devastation would not be repeated. A man named Sissa devises a game that he presents to the kings as the commissioned memorial. Each two-page spread introduces a player and offers reasoning for the moves it is allowed. "These counselors and messengers [the Bishops]...begin the game at the side of their kings and queens in order to whisper advice in their ears. They will move in the direction of their voices. In other words, diagonally." Special moves such as "castling" are also addressed within the framework of the story. The book can serve as a starting place for beginners, but they will need to look elsewhere for more detailed instruction on strategy and defense. Dark, foreboding, and stylized illustrations show the animated versions of the pieces, daggers drawn or advancing on their opponents. They're depicted as grim, fierce characters of battle and evoke images of Lewis Carroll's royal court from Alice in Wonderland. Centuries of play have proven chess' enduring nature.

He shows how the media, both political parties, and the courts have abetted a process that has produced torture, war crimes, domestic spying, and financial fraud. </p><p>Cogent, sharp, and urgent, this is a no-holds-barred indictment of a profoundly un-American system that sanctions immunity at the top and mercilessness for everyone else.</p></p><p><b>GLENN GREENWALD </b>is the author of several best sellers, including <i>How Would a Patriot Act?</i> and <i>With Liberty and Justice for Some</i>. Acclaimed as one of the 25 most influential political commentators by <i>The Atlantic</i> and one of the Top 100 Global Thinkers for 2013 by <i>Foreign Policy</i>, Greenwald is a former constitutional law and civil rights attorney. He was a columnist for <i>The Guardian</i> until October 2013, and is now building a new media organization. He is a frequent guest on CNN, MSNBC, and various other television and radio outlets. Greenwald's NSA reporting in 2013 has won numerous awards, including the top investigative journalism award from the Online Journalism Association, the Esso Award for Excellence in Reporting (the Brazilian equivalent of the Pulitzer Prize), and the 2013 Pioneer Award from the Electronic Frontier Foundation. He was also the recipient of the first annual I.F. Stone Award for Independent Journalism in 2009, and the Online Journalism Association Award in 2010 for his investigative work on the arrest and detention of Bradley Manning. Greenwald is a frequent guest lecturer on college campuses and his work has appeared in many newspapers and political news magazines, including <i>The New York Times</i>, the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, and <i>The American Conservative</i>.<p>Introduction</p><p>As a litigator who practiced for more than a decade in federal and state courts across the country, I've long been aware of the inequities that pervade the American justice system. The rich enjoy superior legal representation and therefore much better prospects for success in court than the poor. The powerful are treated with far more deference by judges than the powerless. The same cultural, socioeconomic, and demographic biases that plague society generally also infect the legal process. Few people who have had any interaction with the justice system would dispute this.</p><p>Still, only when I began regularly writing about politics did I realize that the problem extends well beyond such inequities. The issue isn't just that those with political influence and financial power have some advantages in our judicial system. It is much worse than that. Those with political and financial clout are routinely allowed to break the law with no legal repercussions whatsoever. Often they need not even exploit their access to superior lawyers because they don't see the inside of a courtroom in the first place&#x2014;not even when they get caught in the most egregious criminality. The criminal justice system is now almost exclusively reserved for ordinary Americans, who are routinely subjected to harsh punishments even for the pettiest of offenses.</p><p>The wiretapping scandal of 2005 provides a perfect illustration. In December of that year, the <i>New York Times</i> revealed that officials in George W. Bush's administration were eavesdropping on Americans' telephone calls and e-mails without warrants or judicial oversight: a felony punishable by up to five years in prison and a ten-thousand-dollar fine for each offense. The lawbreaking could not have been clearer, yet virtually nobody in the political and media class was willing to call those acts "criminal," much less to demand legal investigations or prosecutions.</p><p>This was a depressingly familiar pattern for several decades and became particularly pronounced over the last one. America's political and business establishment presided over a series of extraordinary crimes that brought the United States political disgrace and financial ruin: the creation of a global torture regime; the systematic plundering by Wall Street, leading to the 2008 economic crisis; the serial obstruction of justice by high-ranking political officials; the fraudulent home foreclosures by the nation's largest banks. Yet in almost every instance, the perpetrators were shielded from any legal consequences. As these events clearly demonstrate, America's political culture not only provides strategic advantages in the legal system to political and financial elites, but now actually grants them <i>immunity</i> when they knowingly break the law. This license&#x2014;awarded by the same political class that created the world's largest and most merciless prison state for its poorest and most powerless citizens&#x2014;represents not just a departure from the rule of law but a fundamental repudiation of it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The central principle of America's founding was that the rule of law would be the prime equalizing force, the ultimate guardian of justice. The founders considered vast inequality in every other realm to be inevitable and even desirable. Some would be rich, and many would be poor. Some would acquire great power, and many would live their entire lives virtually powerless. A small number of individuals would be naturally endowed with unique and extraordinary talents, while most people, by definition, would be ordinary. Due to those unavoidable circumstances, the American conception of liberty was not only consistent with, but premised on, the inevitability of outcome inequality&#x2014;the success of some people, the failure of others.</p><p>The one exception was the rule of law. When it came to the law, no inequality was tolerable. Law was understood to be the sine qua non ensuring fairness, a level playing field, and a universal set of rules. It was the nonnegotiable prerequisite that made all other forms of inequality acceptable. Only if everyone was bound to the same rules would outcome inequality be justifiable.</p><p>So central is this founding principle that most Americans absorb it by osmosis via numerous clich�s: All are equal before the law. Justice is blind. No man is above the law. We are, in the words of John Adams, "a nation of laws, not men." For Adams, either the law is supreme in all cases, or the arbitrary will of rulers is. Adams and the other founders viewed the preeminence of law over individuals&#x2014;all individuals&#x2014;as the only protection against the tyranny that American colonists had launched a revolution to abolish. For that reason, American political liberty was always inextricably bound to the notion that law reigns supreme.</p><p>It would be difficult to overstate the essential place of the rule of law in the American political tradition. A principal grievance against King George III was his unilateral power to vest in himself and those he favored the right to act outside of the law. The goal of the American Revolution was to replace this arbitrary will of the monarch with unbending equal application of law to everyone. "Where, say some, is the King of America?" Thomas Paine, the great American revolutionary, asked in his 1776 pamphlet <i>Common Sense</i>. His answer:</p><p>Let a crown be placed thereon, by which the world may know, that so far as we approve of monarchy, that in America the Law is King. For as in absolute governments the King is law, so in free countries the law ought to be King; and there ought to be no other.</p><p>Alexander Hamilton did not often see eye to eye with Paine, but on this he heartily agreed. "The instruments by which [government] must act are either the AUTHORITY of the laws or FORCE," he wrote in 1794. "If the first be destroyed, the last must be substituted; and where this becomes the ordinary instrument of government there is an end to liberty!" Like Paine and Hamilton, Adams, in his 1776 <i>Thoughts on Government,</i> put the rule of law at the top of his list of core principles for a free and legitimate government: "The very definition of a republic is &#x2018;an empire of laws, and not of men.' . . . Good government is an empire of laws."</p><p>That last line may at first glance appear simple and even trite, but it contains a critical insight. The supremacy of law is not just one among many instruments of good government; it <i>is</i> good government itself. The converse is equally true: in the absence of the rule of law, good government cannot be said to exist.</p><p>To be sure, there may be exceptional situations where the rule of men might produce better outcomes than the rule of law. A truly magnanimous tyrant, a benevolent dictator, might conceivably lead to more positive results than a regime of unjust laws rigidly applied. Historians can point to emperors who exercised absolute power while advancing the interests of their subjects and the territories they ruled. Nevertheless, such societies should not be confused with "good government," dependent as they are on the fortuitous emergence of an unrestrained leader who is both well-intentioned and relatively immune from the corrupting effects of power (and, even less plausibly, immune from the absolutely corrupting effects of absolute power). A country that prospers by vesting absolute power in a leader who happens to be benevolent could just as easily come under the control of a malevolent leader the next time around. And when that happens, as at some point it surely will, a society without the rule of law will have no means of redress short of violent revolution.</p><p>What's more, even the most well-intentioned leader will eventually abuse his power if he is not constrained by law. Indeed, and somewhat paradoxically, a ruler's belief in his own virtue actually renders abuses of power more likely, since he can rationalize all manner of arbitrary and capricious measures: <i>I am good and </i><i>doing this for good ends, and it is therefore justifiable</i>. Power exercised corruptly inevitably degrades and destroys even genuinely benevolent intent.</p><p>The founders understood that magnanimity is very rarely an enduring safeguard against the corrupting influences of power, and because they understood this, they insisted on the rule of law as the only effective weapon against such temptations. "Why has government been instituted at all?" Hamilton asked in <i>Fed</i><i>eralist 15</i>. "Because the passions of men will not conform to the dictates of reason and justice without constraint." Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1798: "In questions of power, then, let no more be heard of confidence in man, but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the Constitution." Adams, in 1772, put it this way: "There is danger from all men. The only maxim of a free government ought to be to trust no man living with power to endanger the public liberty." Four years later, his wife, Abigail, memorably echoed the same sentiment in a letter to him: "Remember, all men would be tyrants if they could."</p><p>The rule of law does not guarantee good government: an empire of unjust laws can be as tyrannical as an empire of men, perhaps even more so. But though the rule of law is not <i>sufficient</i> by itself to ensure a just and free society, it's absolutely <i>necessary</i> for it. For that reason, a nation that renounces the rule of law has rendered tyranny not only likely but inevitable.</p><p>The fundamental requirement of the rule of law is equality: the uniform application of a set of preexisting rules to everyone, including the rulers. But like the term <i>rule of law, equality under the law</i> has become merely a platitude, a phrase recited without much appreciation of its significance. Everyone claims to believe in it, but hardly anyone remembers what it means. And yet the demand that all be treated equally under the law was no secondary concept to the founding of the United States, but its crux, and it is not difficult to understand why.</p><p>What the founders feared most was that a centr...</p></p><h2>U.S.!: Songs and Stories</h2><p><p><b>In this hilarious and wildly inventive novel, Chris Bachelder brings Upton Sinclair back from the dead to see what he might make of our modern world.</b></p><p><i>U.S.</i><i>!</i> is a playful, darkly comic novel that imagines the serial resurrection and assassination of tireless muckraker Upton Sinclair. In Chris Bachelder's bizarre world, Sinclair is repeatedly brought back by beleaguered but optimistic leftists (whose refrain is "Hope and Shovels Forever"), and then gunned down (and once harpooned!) by those seeking fame, fortune, and American business as usual. As he grows more and more politically and culturally insignificant, Sinclair keeps writing his embarrassingly bad muckraking novels and keeps risking his life for the Socialist revolution, which is perpetually just around the corner. </p><p>In documenting the demise (but dogged faith) of the American Left, as well as the violence and hysteria of the Right, Bachelder uses a wide range of forms: stories, songs, letters, journal entries, book reviews, memos, a syllabus, newspaper and magazine articles, Internet auctions, and transcripts of talk shows, interviews, and toll-free hotlines. The second part of the novel is a fast-paced narrative that brings the myriad characters together in an explosive encounter. A dazzling mix of laughs and revelations, <i>U.S.</i><i>!</i> is not only an exploration of American politics and culture, but an investigation into the possibilities and problems of political art. Its publication will coincide with the hundredth anniversary of the publication of <i>The Jungle</i>, Sinclair's internationally renowned novel about the meat industry.</p></p><p><p><b>Chris Bachelder</b> grew up in Virginia and received an MFA in fiction writing from the University of Florida. He is currently an assistant professor at Colorado College, and is the author of the novel <i>Bear v. Shark</i>, which was published in four countries.</p>In his second satiric novel, following the hilarious <i>Bear vs. Shark</i> (2001), Bachelder supposes that muckraker Upton Sinclair, author of <i>The Jungle</i>, has the power to repeatedly rise from the grave, "oft-resurrected and oft-assassinated" by his followers and foes. A haggard and bullet-ridden Sinclair symbolizes the bedraggled American political left (making a triple entendre of the book's title). In Bachelder's present-day America, capitalism-loving smalltown residents fear a Socialist uprising spurred by the mediocre novels Sinclair continues to publish. Sinclair assassins (such as three-time killer Huntley and crazed young upstart Billings) make the cover of <i>Time</i> and write bestselling memoirs. The first of the novel's two main parts comprises a funny, though gimmicky, series of Sinclair ephemera, including a bile-filled book review, transcripts from the Sinclair-sighting telephone hotline and "Professor" Sinclair's writing workshop syllabus instructing students to "write socially engaged, morally outraged fiction with unambiguous endings." Part two is a gripping narrative in which an anti-Socialist book-burning becomes the converging point for Sinclair , his forlorn folksinger son Albert, competing assassins and a 12-year-old convert to liberal politics who may be the crumbling left's best hopes. Readers require no knowledge of the historical Sinclair to relate to Bachelder's bumbling, endearing idealist grandpa in this entertaining though uneven sophomore outing. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

What he found illuminated not only More's own life but painted a clear and satisfying picture of the way the First Comers, Saints and Strangers alike, set off for the new land, suffered the voyage on the Mayflower, and put down their roots to thrive on our continent's northeastern shore. From the story, Richard emerges as a man of questionable morals, much enterprise, and a good deal of old-fashioned pluck, a combination that could get him into trouble-and often did. He lived to father several children, to see, near the end of his life, a friend executed as a witch in Salem, and to be read out of the church for unseemly behavior. Mayflower Bastard lets readers see history in a new light by turning an important episode into a personal experience. <br></p><p>The subject of David Lindsay's <i>Mayflower Bastard</i> is Richard More, a distant kinsman of Lindsay's. More, the 5-year-old, illegitimate offspring of a headstrong Shropshire woman and a man of "mean parentage," arrived in the New World on the <i>Mayflower</i>. He would live long enough to witness the hysteria of the Salem witch trials--and see a friend, accused of wizardry, "pressed" to death by stones. More was a sea captain, merchant, and tavern keeper. He was also an adulterer and a bigamist, whose wives lived on both sides of the Atlantic, forcing him to appear a Puritan in one country, and anything but in the other. What emerges is an intimate portrait of a world hardly holy--far more venal, vindictive, complex, and, especially, litigious than is usually believed. Lindsay's account is a stylistic m�lange of first-person, second-person, and third-person history sprinkled with a few present-day anecdotes, in which the author retraces some of More's journeys. While this unorthodox approach lends the subject matter a certain gravity, at times it is merely obfuscatory. <i>--H. O'Billovich</i>David Lindsay has previously published several books, including <i>The Patent Files: Dispatches from the Frontiers of Invention</i> and <i>Madness in the Making: The Triumphant Rise and Untimely Fall of America's Show Inventors </i>. He has also written for <i>New York Press, American Heritage, The Village Voice, The Wall Street Journal </i>and <i>The American Experience</i>.

Ashliman</b> is emeritus professor at the University of Pittsburgh. He taught folklore, mythology, German, and comparative literature at that institution for thirty-one years. He has also served as guest professor at the University of Augsburg in Germany.<b>From D. L Asliman's Introduction to <i>Aesop's Fables</i></b><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t count your chickens before they are hatched!&#x201d; &#x201c;He is a wolf in sheep&#x2019;s clothing.&#x201d; &#x201c;She has a sour-grapes attitude.&#x201d; &#x201c;They are killing the goose that laid the golden eggs.&#x201d; &#x201c;He demands the lion&#x2019;s share.&#x201d; &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be like the boy who called &#x2018;wolf!&#x2019;&#x201d; These expressions are so much a part of our everyday language and culture that they seem to have been with us forever, and that is almost the case, for the fables that produced these proverbial sayings are indeed even older than (to name but three) the modern English, French, and German languages where today they are so much at home. The fables behind these sayings are those of arguably the most famous storyteller of all time, the legendary Aesop. Who was the man who created these timeless literary gems? </p><b>The Man Aesop</b> <p>Aesop (sometimes spelled �sop, �sopus, Esop, Esope, or&#x2014;using the Greek form of his name&#x2014;Aisopos) has been known in history and in legend since the fifth century b.c., or earlier, as a gifted Greek storyteller and the author of the world&#x2019;s best-known collection of fables. However, it cannot be proven with any degree of certainty that he existed as a real person. Most modern scholars believe that Aesop was instead a name invented, already in antiquity, to provide attribution for a body of oral tales whose true authors were a number of anonymous storytellers. Martin Luther expressed this view some 500 years ago: &#x201c;Attributing these stories to Aesop is, in my opinion, itself a fiction. Perhaps there has never been on earth a man by the name of Aesop&#x201d; (quoted in Jacobs, <i>History of the Aesopic Fabl</i>, p. 15; see &#x201c;For Further Reading&#x201d;). </p><p>Although it is possible that there was indeed a gifted Greek storyteller by the name of Aesop, his reputation expanded to legendary proportions in the decades and centuries following his death, and with time many more stories and deeds were credited to him than he could have composed and performed. Supporting this view, many of the earliest references to the stories of Aesop refer to Aesopic (or Aesopian) fables rather than Aesop&#x2019;s fables. In other words, Aesopic, an adjective, describes a kind of story and a literary tradition but does not claim to identify a specific author. </p><p>One thing is certain: Aesop, if he existed at all, did not leave behind a collection of written fables. His reputation is that of an oral storyteller, not an author of written literature. The oldest references to his fables refer to tales memorized and retold, not written and read. For example, from Aristophanes&#x2019;s comedy <i>Wasps</i> (written in 422 b.c.) we learn that telling anecdotes and comic stories in the style of Aesop was common entertainment at banquets in ancient Athens. More seriously, in 360 b.c. Plato recorded in his dialog <i>Phaedo</i> (section 61b) that Socrates, under sentence of death in prison, diverted himself by reformulating some of Aesop&#x2019;s fables. Plato&#x2019;s Phaedo quotes Socrates himself: &#x201c;I took some fables of Aesop, which I had ready at hand and knew, and turned them into verse.&#x201d; The doomed philosopher did not have a book or manuscript of Aesop&#x2019;s fables in prison with him, if such a book or manuscript even existed at the time. He knew the fables from memory, as did the partygoers in Aristophanes&#x2019;s comedy. </p><p>The most frequently cited ancient reference to the man Aesop is found in the <i>History</i> of the Greco-Persian Wars written by the Greek historian Herodotus about 425 b.c. Here we learn that Aesop, the fable writer, was a slave of Iadmon, son of Hephaestopolis, a Samian, and that Iadmon&#x2019;s grandson (also named Iadmon) claimed and received compensation for the murder of Aesop. If this account is true, Aesop would have lived during the sixth century b.c. Apart from this sketchy biography, Herodotus recorded essentially no additional details about the fable writer. </p><p>However, later Greek and Roman writers were not so reticent. One body of literature is particularly relevant in this regard. Usually referred to as <i>The Life of Aesop</i>, this work has survived in a number of medieval manuscripts by different anonymous compilers and is based on earlier accounts, now lost. The statements about Aesop&#x2019;s life history contained in the different versions of this work often contradict one another, or they are so miraculous and fantastic as to be unbelievable by modern standards. </p><p>The ultimate source of these accounts is undoubtedly folklore: anonymous legends told and retold by generations of oral storytellers. <i>The Life of Aesop</i> is today generally held to be fiction, but as is the case with many legends, there could be at least a kernel of truth in one or more of the episodes. The following biographical outline has been gleaned from different versions of <i>The Life of Aesop</i>, most prominently the accounts published by Lloyd W. Daly in his <i>Aesop without Morals</i> (pp. 31&#x2013;90) and the <i>Everyman&#x2019;s Library</i> version of <i>Aesop: Fables</i> (pp. 17&#x2013;45). </p><p>Aesop was born a slave, or possibly was captured into slavery at an early age. His birthplace is variously stated as Thrace, Phrygia, Ethiopia, Samos, Athens, or Sardis. He was dark-skinned. In fact, it is said that his name was derived from <i>Aethiop</i> (Ethiopian). He was physically deformed: a hunchback, pot belly, misshapen head, snub nose, and bandy legs are often mentioned. Although in his early years he suffered from a serious speech impediment, or&#x2014;according to some&#x2014;the inability to speak at all, he was cured through the intervention of a deity and became a gifted orator, especially skillful at incorporating fables into his speeches. </p><p>As a young man Aesop was transported by a slave trader to Ephesus (in modern Turkey). Because of his grotesque appearance, no one there would buy him, so he was taken to the island of Samos, where he was examined by Xanthus, identified in the manuscripts as &#x201c;an eminent philosopher,&#x201d; but a person whose existence cannot be verified historically. At first repulsed by Aesop&#x2019;s appearance, Xanthus changed his mind when the slave proclaimed, &#x201c;A philosopher should value a man for his mind, not for his body.&#x201d; Impressed with Aesop&#x2019;s astuteness, Xanthus purchased him as a manservant for his wife. </p><p>Aesop soon proved himself to be an irreverent and sarcastic trickster with a clever retort for every occasion. The following episode is typical of many others illustrating how Aesop&#x2019;s quick wit saved him from punishment, sometimes deserved, sometimes not: Xanthus, wanting to know what fate awaited him on a particular day, sent Aesop to see if any crows were outside the door. According to popular belief, two crows would portend good fortune, whereas a single crow would be an omen of bad luck. Aesop saw a pair of crows and reported this to his master, who then set forth with good cheer. Upon opening the door, Xanthus saw only a single crow, for one of them had flown away, and he angrily turned on his slave for having tricked him into beginning a dangerous venture. &#x201c;You shall be whipped for this!&#x201d; said Xanthus, and while Aesop was being readied for his punishment a messenger arrived at the door with an invitation for Xanthus to dine with his friends. &#x201c;Your omens have no meaning!&#x201d; cried Aesop. &#x201c;I saw the auspicious pair of crows, yet I am about to be beaten like a dog, whereas you saw the ominous single crow, and you are about to make merry with your friends.&#x201d; Perceiving the irony and the wisdom of this observation, Xanthus released Aesop and spared him the threatened punishment. </p><p>Aesop&#x2019;s cleverness extended from word to deed. An unrepentant trickster, his pranks ranged from tricking his fellow slaves into carrying the heavier burdens to seducing his master&#x2019;s wife with her unwitting husband&#x2019;s apparent blessing. His tricks often were masked by feigned stupidity on his part, which has led commentators to compare him to the German Till Eulenspiegel and the Turkish Nasreddin Hoca, two of the world&#x2019;s most rascally but beloved tricksters. </p><p>Aesop&#x2019;s legendary wisdom and shrewdness sometimes moved into the realm of the supernatural. He could solve seemingly impossible riddles and conundrums, foretell the future with uncanny accuracy, and unerringly discover hidden treasures. A master of human psychology, he understood what motivated people to act, and used this knowledge to manipulate them to his advantage. As his life progressed he moved to ever greater venues: from a trickster in a slave&#x2019;s workroom to a lecturer in a philosopher&#x2019;s auditorium to a diplomat and councilor in the courts of governors and kings. </p><p>With time his cunning, wisdom, and oratory skills brought him freedom from slavery, but in the end they cost him his life. At Delphi the citizens, offended by his lack of respect for their aristocracy and for their principal deity Apollo, planted a golden cup in his baggage, then accused him of temple theft. </p><p>Sentenced to die by being thrown over a cliff, Aesop pleaded his case with a series of fables, one of which was the story of &#x201c;The Mouse, the Frog, and the Hawk&#x201d; (no. 67 in the present collection). In this tale a frog and a mouse go swimming together in a pool with their feet tied together, but the mouse drowns. The frog, burdened by the dead mouse, is now an easy prey for a hawk, which forthwith captures and devours him. </p><p>Aesop compared himself to the mouse and the Delphians to the frog. &#x201c;You may kill me,&#x201d; he predicted, &#x201c;but my unjust death will bring you great misfortune.&#x201d; Aesop was executed near Delphi, and his dire prediction came true. Shortly after his death the region was visited with famine, pestilence, and warfare. The Delphians consulted the Oracle of Apollo as to the source of these calamities, and they received the answer that they were to make amends for the unjust death of Aesop. Accordingly they built there a pyramid in his honor.<br></p></p><h2>Khrushchev Remembers: The Last Testament (Illustrated)</h2><p>The second volume of Khrushchev&#39;s memoirs bears all the voiceprints of a lovable dodo. The ex-Premier, musing in retirement, blusters about Stalin&#39;s mistakes -- for example, the postwar drive to build up, of all things, a conventional navy. And at the same time he shares Stalin&#39;s humble reflex of gratification when any capitalist spokesman (de Gaulle called me mon ami!) acts civil. Indeed, the book outweighs tons of revisionist historical tracts in its lively demonstration of the unbroken tradition of defensive postures by the Soviets. Of course there is also an obbligato of self-justification, both national (China&#39;s irrationality) and personal (Khrushchev disapproved of sending troops into Poland). On the Cuban missile crisis, the Vienna meeting with JFK, etc. Khrushchev&#39;s recollections amplify the impression of gratitude for small things won or not lost. Khrushchev meets the U.S. brewery workers&#39; head and &#34;When he reached for another glass of beer I noticed he had gold wrist watches on both his left and right arms. What did he think they were, decorations? Bracelets?&#34; His scorn is equaled only by his enthusiasm for such bourgeois rulers as Nehru and General Ne Win of Burma. Echt Khrushchevisms persist as he rumbles and bumbles on the subject of agriculture. Some reviewers wondered whether the memoirs are a fabrication. If so, this volume represents a slick job by someone with an excellent psychological profile of the man; both Khrushchev&#39;s true simple-mindedness and his shrewd-simple Ukrainian persona come through in a fashion as memorable as these grave years.</p><p></p><h2>Bitter Medicine (A V.I.

Jean Louise is a 30-ish book designer for a New York publishing house, regularly hit on by her rakish boss Sven and confused by the disloyalties of her female co-workers--yet she's essentially blissful thanks to her marriage to calm, unanxious chemist Teddy. She has a wonderful best friend, too--Edie, a caterer, who with her black husband Mokie replicates Jean Louise's contentment pretty much down the line. Jean Louise's problem is that at base she feels herself hardly deserving of such happiness- -not for anything she's done, but because of the skeptical, hard-on-herself person she just generally is. When she gives birth to a child, Miranda, the wry joy is only intensified. But a part of her still wonders whether she wouldn't be more temperamentally suited to hopping into bed with Sven the rou&#x201a; and suffering the consequences luxuriously. Everything you expect in a Colwin novel is here--Jean-Louise and Edie, plus their spouses, seem like updates, in fact, of the delightful, too-good-to-be-true pair of couples that roamed through Colwin's best novel, Happy All the Time (1978)--and all that's missing is drama, some wrinkling that might leave any of the characters somewhat different or changed at the end from what they were at the beginning. The lack of architectural tone makes the book read like a series of skits, set-pieces, all feeling a bit skimpy, abridged. Still, Colwin's many fans will savor the willfulness, wisdom, and the sharp-eyed noticings here. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

In the world of the novel there is a Spanish galleon beached in the jungle, a flying carpet, and an iguana in a woman&#39;s womb. It won the 1982 Nobel Prize for literature.</p><p><i>"Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buend�a was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice."</i><p> It is typical of Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez that it will be many pages before his narrative circles back to the ice, and many chapters before the hero of <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i>, Buend�a, stands before the firing squad. In between, he recounts such wonders as an entire town struck with insomnia, a woman who ascends to heaven while hanging laundry, and a suicide that defies the laws of physics: </p><blockquote> A trickle of blood came out under the door, crossed the living room, went out into the street, continued on in a straight line across the uneven terraces, went down steps and climbed over curbs, passed along the Street of the Turks, turned a corner to the right and another to the left, made a right angle at the Buend�a house, went in under the closed door, crossed through the parlor, hugging the walls so as not to stain the rugs, went on to the other living room, made a wide curve to avoid the dining-room table, went along the porch with the begonias, and passed without being seen under Amaranta's chair as she gave an arithmetic lesson to Aureliano Jos�, and went through the pantry and came out in the kitchen, where �rsula was getting ready to crack thirty-six eggs to make bread.<br> "Holy Mother of God!" �rsula shouted. </blockquote><p> The story follows 100 years in the life of Macondo, a village founded by Jos� Arcadio Buend�a and occupied by descendants all sporting variations on their progenitor's name: his sons, Jos� Arcadio and Aureliano, and grandsons, Aureliano Jos�, Aureliano Segundo, and Jos� Arcadio Segundo. Then there are the women--the two �rsulas, a handful of Remedios, Fernanda, and Pilar--who struggle to remain grounded even as their menfolk build castles in the air. If it is possible for a novel to be highly comic and deeply tragic at the same time, then <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i> does the trick. Civil war rages throughout, hearts break, dreams shatter, and lives are lost, yet the effect is literary pentimento, with sorrow's outlines bleeding through the vibrant colors of Garc�a M�rquez's magical realism. Consider, for example, the ghost of Prudencio Aguilar, whom Jos� Arcadio Buend�a has killed in a fight. So lonely is the man's shade that it haunts Buend�a's house, searching anxiously for water with which to clean its wound. Buend�a's wife, �rsula, is so moved that "the next time she saw the dead man uncovering the pots on the stove she understood what he was looking for, and from then on she placed water jugs all about the house." </p><p> With <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i> Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez introduced Latin American literature to a world-wide readership. Translated into more than two dozen languages, his brilliant novel of love and loss in Macondo stands at the apex of 20th-century literature. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p><p><em>One Hundred Years of Solitude</em> tells the story of the rise and fall, birth and death of the mythical town of Macondo through the history of the Buend�a family. Inventive, amusing, magnetic, sad, and alive with unforgettable men and women -- brimming with truth, compassion, and a lyrical magic that strikes the soul -- this novel is a masterpiece in the art of fiction.</p></p><h2>Experiencing Ministry Supervision</h2><p>A useful and thorough presentation of the most important dimension of a supervised ministry program written by experienced and competent leaders in the field.</p><p></p><h2>From the Holy Mountain: A Journey among the Christians of the Middle East</h2><p><p>In 587 a.d., two monks set off on an extraordinary journey that would take them in an arc across the entire Byzantine world, from the shores of the Bosphorus to the sand dunes of Egypt. On the way John Moschos and his pupil Sophronius the Sophist stayed in caves, monasteries, and remote hermitages, collecting the wisdom of the stylites and the desert fathers before their fragile world finally shattered under the great eruption of Islam. More than a thousand years later, using Moschos's writings as his guide, William Dalrymple sets off to retrace their footsteps and composes "an evensong for a dying civilization" --<i>Kirkus Reviews,</i> starred review</p></p><p><p><b>William Dalrymple </b>is the award-winning author of the British bestsellers<i> In Xanadu</i> and <i>The City of Djinns</i>. He divides his time between London, Edinburgh, and Delhi.</p>A memorable historical journey through the twilight of Eastern Christianity in the Middle East, heartfelt and beautifully told. Dalrymple (The City of Djinns: A Year in Delhi, 1994) has carved an unorthodox niche for an English travel writer: He is following in the 1,400-year-old path of an Orthodox monk. In 587, Friar John Moschos and a young student trekked across the Middle East, collecting precious relics and manuscripts from obscure monasteries, from present-day Turkey to Egypt. Dalrymples quest is similar; he is preserving the stories of the last generation of Orthodox Christians in the Middle East. Retracing Moschoss steps, Dalrymple finds once glorious Christian communities on the brink of extinction. One Turkish village that had 17 Syrian Orthodox churches now has only one [Christian] inhabitant, its elderly priest. In Turkey, Armenian Christianity has been more systematically erased, with cathedrals renovated into mosques, gravestones obliterated, and any mention of the Armenian presence in Turkey censored from publications, turning their existence into a historical myth. In one town, Dalrymple interviews a superannuated survivor of the Syrian Christian resistance of 1915, when Syrians witnessed the genocide of the Armenians and knew that they were next to be deported. Today, however, the descendants of Orthodox Christians in Turkey and elsewhere are emigrating as quickly as they can. Old churches stand abandoned or are employed for other purposesin Istanbul, for example, Dalrymple is denied entrance to a famous basilica because there is a Turkish beauty contest going on inside. Dalrymple is a talented writer, with a subtle wit, a keen eye for historical irony, and a relish for architectural detail. If his treatment of Eastern Orthodoxy is somewhat romantic, ignoring centuries of internecine conflict among various ethnic groups, it is understandable given his urgency to record the plight of this last generation of Orthodox practitioners in Muslim-dominated areas.

Eugenia Price is America's&nbsp;&nbsp;first lady of storytelling. For thirty years she has&nbsp;&nbsp;captivated millions of readers with her sweeping&nbsp;&nbsp;historical novels of the antebellum South. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;with <i>Beauty From Ashes</i>, the final&nbsp;&nbsp;installment of her Georgia Trilogy (which includes&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The New York Times</i> best-seller&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Bright Captivity</i> and <i>Where&nbsp;&nbsp;Shadows Go</i> ), Ms. Price returns to her&nbsp;&nbsp;beloved South, but it's the South of heartbreak and&nbsp;&nbsp;Civil War. It is 1852. After recovering from the&nbsp;&nbsp;death of her husband and her parents, Anne Couper&nbsp;&nbsp;Fraser is devastated to learn that she has also&nbsp;&nbsp;lost her home on St. Simons Island. Seeking refuge in&nbsp;&nbsp;Marietta, Georgia, some three hundred miles from&nbsp;&nbsp;the solace of her home on the Georgia coast, Anne&nbsp;&nbsp;finds the perfect house -- a place she can again&nbsp;&nbsp;call "home." As she is adjusting to this&nbsp;&nbsp;new life the chill of war sweeps in. And as&nbsp;&nbsp;happened to so many Southern families, the Frasers split&nbsp;&nbsp;when Anne's son and grandson, who are loathe to&nbsp;&nbsp;turn against their Southern roots, enlist in the&nbsp;&nbsp;Confederate Army. Anne, who sympathizes with the&nbsp;&nbsp;Unionists, finds her loyalties torn. Then, facing her&nbsp;&nbsp;own mortality, and befriended by a young Union&nbsp;&nbsp;doctor, Anne rediscovers the depth of her faith, and&nbsp;&nbsp;learns that even the cruelest misfortune does not&nbsp;&nbsp;mean defeat for the human spirit. Filled with&nbsp;&nbsp;characters drawn from history, lore, and Ms. Price's&nbsp;&nbsp;own fertile imagination, <i>Beauty From&nbsp;&nbsp;Ashes</i> is a touching, inspirational story of&nbsp;&nbsp;courage, love, and friendship that is guaranteed to&nbsp;&nbsp;capture the hearts and minds of new and devoted&nbsp;&nbsp;readers alike.</p><p><p><b>Eugenia Price, 79, Romance Novelist, Dies</b></p><p>By Robert McG. Thomas Jr., May 30, 1996, <i>The New York Times</i></p><p>Eugenia Price, who turned a chance visit to coastal Georgia into a career as the South's most popular writer of antebellum romantic fiction, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Brunswick, Ga., not far from her home in St. Simons, the island she made famous through a series of novels. She was 79.</p><p>Her companion, Joyce Blackburn, said the cause was congestive heart failure.</p><p>Her hoop-skirted heroines tended to be too unremittingly beautiful, her handsome heroes a shade too dashing and their problems a bit too easily solved for Ms. Price to have won serious literary acclaim. But then again, how many acclaimed authors sell more than 40 million books in 18 languages?</p><p>That Ms. Price did just that was a tribute both to her ability as a storyteller and her knack for recreating a bygone era with such compelling and authentic historic detail that, according to the St. Simons's Chamber of Commerce, a substantial majority of the thousands of tourists who visit the island each year come there specifically to scout out the houses, marshes and other locales she used in her novels, not to mention the headstones of the actual people she brought back to life as fictional characters.</p><p>Ms. Price, a dentist's daughter from Charleston, W.Va., was a precocious student who entered Ohio University at 16 and later studied dentistry at Northwestern University before dropping out of school to pursue a writing career.</p><p>Those familiar with the intensely romantic themes of her fiction would not be surprised that she began her career writing soap operas, initially in Chicago and later in New York and Cincinnati, the headquarters of Procter &amp; Gamble.</p><p>An intense conversion to Christianity in the late 1940's altered the course of her life and of her writing. Abandoning soap operas, she began turning out inspirational books -- among them <i>Discoveries</i>, <i>Beloved World</i>, and <i>The Eugenia Price Treasury of Faith</i> -- that won her a wide following long before she turned to fiction.<i>Indeed, it was while on a tour in 1960 to promote one of her two dozen inspirational titles that she and Ms. Blackburn, who had been living in Chicago, happened to stop off in St. Simons and were so enchanted by the beauty and ambiance of the place that they decided they never wanted to leave.</i><i>It was a measure of their immediate and intense devotion to the island that the two women bought cemetery plots there before they built the house they named Dodge after the real St. Simons clergyman who, with his two wives, became the focus of Ms. Price's first novels, <i>Lighthouse</i>, <i>New Moon Rising</i>, and <i>Beloved Invader</i>.</i></p><p><i>Those books were such a succcess that she wrote a Florida Trilogy and a Savannah Quartet before a turning out a final Georgia Trilogy, whose return to the familiar St. Simons settings helped propel the first book of the final series, <i>Bright Captivity</i> (1991), to The New York Times best-seller list. The third, <i>Beauty from Ashes<i> (1995), was also a best seller. Her last book, <i>The Waiting Time</i>, is to be published next year by Doubleday.</i></i></i></p><p><i><i>Ms. Blackburn, a writer who subsumed her own career to serve as Ms. Price's live-in editor, is her only survivor.</i></i></p>The conclusion to Price's Georgia Trilogy (Bright Captivity; Where Shadows Go) will please her fans but will probably underwhelm those new to her work. As the story reopens in 1845, Anne Couper Fraser is living with her four children at Lawrence, their beloved home on St. Simons Island. Still mourning her late husband, Anne finds comfort only in an unlikely friendship with Eve, a family slave. When her precarious finances force her to give up Lawrence, she is brokenhearted. Though she moves with her children into her brother's household, she never abandons hope that she will again have a home of her own. Finally, she manages to buy a house in Marietta, a small town outside Atlanta. These are years of great change for Anne and her family. On a visit to Florida, her tomboy daughter, Rebecca, now in her 30s, meets a young doctor who follows her back to Marietta. And Anne finds that not all her children share her strong abolitionist views?daughters Fanny and Selina fall in love with men favoring secession, while her son and her grandson join the Confederate Army when the Civil War breaks out. Anne nobly weathers the many tragedies that war brings (even the occupation of her home by Sherman's troops), but her gentility as a sheltered flower of the Old South may leave many longing for a bit of Scarlett O'Hara's fire.

For more information, see his website at www.johnconnolly.co.uk.The Lovers <br>CHAPTER ONE<br> <br>THE FARADAY BOY HAD been missing for three days.<br> <br>On the first day, nothing was done. After all, he was twenty-one, and young men of that age no longer had to abide by curfews and parental rules. Still, his behavior was out of character for him. Bobby Faraday was trustworthy. He was a graduate student, although he had taken a year off before deciding on the direction of his graduate studies in engineering, with talk of going abroad for a couple of months, or working for his uncle in San Diego. Instead, he had stayed in his hometown, saving money by living with his parents and banking as much of what he earned as he could, which was a little less than the previous year as he could now drink with impunity, and was maybe indulging that newfound liberty with more enthusiasm than might have been considered entirely wise. He&#x2019;d had a couple of killer hangovers over New Year&#x2019;s, that was for sure, and his old man had advised him to ease up before his liver started crying out for mercy, but Bobby was young, he was immortal, and he was in love, or had been until recently. Perhaps it would be truer to say that Bobby Faraday was still in love, but the object of his affection had moved on, leaving Bobby mired in his own emotions. The girl was why he had opted to remain in town instead of seeing a little more of the world, a decision that had been met with mixed feelings by his parents: gratitude on the part of his mother, disappointment on that of his father. There had been some arguments about it at the start, but now, as with two reluctant armies on the verge of an unwanted battle, a truce of kinds had been declared between father and son, although each side continued to watch the other warily to see which one might blink first. Meanwhile, Bobby drank, and his father fumed, but remained silent in the hope that the ending of the relationship might lead his son to broaden his horizons until grad school in the fall.<br> <br>Despite his occasional overindulgences, Bobby was never late for work at the auto shop and gas station, and usually left a little later than he had to, because there was always something to be done, some task that he did not wish to abandon uncompleted, even if it could be finished quickly and easily in the morning. It was one of the reasons his father, whatever their disagreements, didn&#x2019;t worry too much about his son&#x2019;s future prospects: Bobby was too conscientious to leave the beaten track for long. He liked order, and always had. He&#x2019;d never been one of those messy teenagers, either in appearance or in approach. It just wasn&#x2019;t in his nature.<br> <br>But he hadn&#x2019;t come home the night before, and he hadn&#x2019;t called to tell his parents where he might be, and that in itself was unusual. Then he didn&#x2019;t make it to work the following morning, which was so out of character that Ron Nevill, who owned the gas station, called the Faraday house to check on the boy and make sure that he wasn&#x2019;t ailing. His mother expressed surprise that her son wasn&#x2019;t already at work. She&#x2019;d simply assumed that he&#x2019;d come home late and left early. She checked his bedroom, which lay just off the basement den. His bed had not been slept in, and there was no indication that he&#x2019;d spent the night on the couch instead.<br> <br>When there was no word by 3 P.M., she called her husband at work. Together they checked with Bobby&#x2019;s friends, casual acquaintances, and his ex-girlfriend, Emily Kindler. That last call had been delicate, as she and Bobby had broken up only a couple of weeks before. His father suspected that this was the reason his son was drinking more than he should have, but he wouldn&#x2019;t have been the first man who tried to drown love&#x2019;s sorrows in a batch of alcohol. The trouble was that frustrated love was buoyant in booze: the more you tried to force it to the bottom, the more it insisted on bobbing right back up to the top.<br> <br>Nobody had heard from Bobby, or had seen him, since the previous day. When 7 P.M. came and went, they called the police. The chief was skeptical. He was new in town, but familiar with the ways of young people. Nevertheless, he accepted that this was not typical behavior for Bobby Faraday, and that twenty-four hours had now gone by since he left the gas station, for Bobby had not hit any of the local bars after work, and Ron Nevill seemed to be the last person to have seen him. The chief put together a description of the boy at the Faraday house, borrowed a photograph that had been taken the previous summer, and informed local law enforcement and the state police of a possible missing person. None of the other agencies responded with any great urgency, for they were almost as cynical about the behavior of young males as the chief was, and in the case of one going missing, they tended to wait for seventy-two hours before assuming that there might be more to the disappearance than a simple case of booze, hormones, or domestic difficulties.<br> <br>On the second day, his parents, and their friends, began an informal canvass of the town and its environs, with no result. When it began to grow dark, his mother and father returned home, but they did not sleep that night, just as they had not slept the night before. His mother lay in bed, her face turned toward the window, straining to hear the sound of approaching footsteps, the familiar tread of her only son returning to her at last. She stirred only slightly when she heard her husband rise and put on his robe.<br> <br>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; she asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to make some tea, sit up for a while.&#x201d; He paused. &#x201c;You want some?&#x201d;<br> <br>But she knew that he was asking only out of politeness, that he would prefer it if she stayed where she was. He did not want them to sit at the kitchen table in silence, together but apart, the fears of one feeding those of the other. He wanted to be alone. So she let him go, and when the bedroom door closed behind him, she began to cry.<br> <br>On the third day, the formal search began.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>The golden host moved as one, countless shapes bending obediently in unison at the gentle touch of the late-winter breeze, like a congregation at church bowing in accordance with the progress of the service, awaiting the moment of consecration that is to come.<br> <br>They whispered to themselves, a soft, low susurrus that might have been the crashing of distant waves were such an alien noise not unknown in this landlocked place. The paleness of them was dappled in spots by small flowers of red and orange and blue, a scattering of petals upon an ocean of seed and stem.<br> <br>The host had been spared the reaping, and had grown tall, too tall, even as the crop decayed. A season&#x2019;s grain had gone to waste, for the old man upon whose land the host was gathered had died the previous summer, and his relatives were fighting over the sale of the property and how the proceeds would be divided. While they fought, the host had stretched skyward, a sea of dull gold in the depths of winter, speaking in hushed tones of what lay, rush hemmed and undiscovered, nearby.<br> <br>And yet the host, it seemed, was at peace.<br> <br>Suddenly, the breeze dropped for an instant and the host stood erect, as though troubled by the change, sensing that all was not as it had been, and then the wind rose again, more tempestuous now, transforming into smaller, dispersed gusts that divided the host with ripples and eddies, their caresses less delicate than what had gone before. Unity was replaced by confusion. Scattered fragments were caught in the sunlight before they fell to the ground. The whispering grew louder, drowning the calling of a solitary bird with rumors of approach.<br> <br>A black shape appeared upon the horizon, like a great insect hovering over the stalks. It grew in stature, becoming the head, shoulders, and body of a man, passing between the rows of wheat while, ahead of him, a smaller form cleaved invisibly through the stalks, sniffing and yelping as it went, the first intruders upon the host&#x2019;s territory since the old man had died.<br> <br>A second figure came into view, heavier than the first. This one seemed to be struggling with the terrain and with the unaccustomed exercise that his participation in the search had forced upon him. In the distance, but farther to the east, the two men could see other searchers. Somehow, they had drifted away from the main pack, although that itself had diminished as the day wore on. Already the light was fading. Soon it would be time to call a halt, and there would be fewer of them to search in the days that followed.<br> <br>They had begun that morning, immediately after Sunday services. The searchers had congregated at the Catholic church, St. Jude&#x2019;s, since that had the largest yard and, curiously, the smallest congregation, a contradiction that Peyton Carmichael, the man with the dog, had never quite understood. Perhaps, he figured, they were expecting a mass conversion at some point in the future, which made him wonder if Catholics were just more optimistic than other folks.<br> <br>The chief of police and his men had divided the township into grids, and the townspeople themselves into groups, and had assigned each group an area to search. Sandwiches, potato chips, and sodas in brown bags had been provided by the various churches, although most people had brought food and water of their own, just in case. In a break with Sunday tradition, none had dressed up in the usual finery. Instead, they wore loose shirts and old pants, and battered boots or comfortable sneakers. Some carried sticks, others garden rakes to search in the undergrowth. There was an air of subdued expectation, a kind of excitement despite the task before them. They shared rides, and drove out to their assigned areas. As each area was searched, and nothing found, another was suggested either by the cops who were coordinating the efforts on the ground, or by contacting the base of operations that had been set up in the hall behind the church.<br> <br>It had been unseasonably warm when they began, a curious false thaw that would soon end, and the difficulty of coping with soft ground and melting snow had sapped the strength of many before they took a break for lunch at about one or one thirty. Some of the older people had returned home at that stage, content to have made some effort for the Faradays, but the rest continued with the search. After all, the next day was Monday. There would be work to do, obligations to be met. This day was the only one that they could spare to look for the boy, and the best would have to be made of it. But as the light had grown dim, so too the day had grown colder, and Peyton was grateful that he had not left his Timberland jacket in the car but had chosen to tie it around his waist until it was needed.<br> <br>He whistled at his dog, a three-year-old spaniel named Molly, and waited, once again, for his companion to catch up. Artie Hoyt: of all the people with whom he had to end up. Relations between the two men had been cool for the last year or more, ever since Artie had caught Peyton eyeing his daughter&#x2019;s ass at church. It didn&#x2019;t matter to Artie that he hadn&#x2019;t seen exactly what he thought he&#x2019;d seen. Yes, Peyton had been looking at his daughter&#x2019;s ass, but not out of any feelings of lust or attraction. Not that he was above such base impulses: at times, the pastor&#x2019;s sermons were so dull that the only thing keeping Peyton awake was the sight of young, lithe female forms draped in their Sunday best. Peyton was long past the age when he might have been troubled by the potential implications for his immortal soul of such carnal thoughts in church. He figured that God had better things to worry about than whether Peyton Carmichael, sixty-four, widower, was paying more attention to objects of female beauty than he was to the old blowhard at the pulpit, a man who, in Peyton&#x2019;s opinion, possessed less Christian charity than the average alligator. As Peyton&#x2019;s doctor liked to tell him, live a life of wine, women, and song, all in moderation but always of the proper vintage. Peyton&#x2019;s wife had died three years earlier, taken by breast cancer, and although there were plenty of women in town of the correct vintage who might have been prepared to offer Peyton some comfort on a winter&#x2019;s evening, he just wasn&#x2019;t interested. He had loved his wife. Occasionally he was still lonely, although less often than before, but those feelings of loneliness were specific, not general: he missed his wife, not female company, and he viewed the occasional pleasure that he took in the sight of a young, good-looking woman merely as a sign that he was not entirely dead below the waist. God, having taken his wife from him, could allow him that small indulgence. If God was going to make a big deal of it, then, well, Peyton would have a few words for Him too, when eventually they met.<br> <br>The problem with Artie Hoyt&#x2019;s daughter was that, although she was young, she was by no means good looking. Neither was she lithe. In fact, she was the opposite of lithe and, come to think of it, the opposite of light too. She&#x2019;d never been what you might call svelte, but then she had left town and gone to live in Baltimore, and by the time she came back she&#x2019;d piled on the pounds. Now, when she walked into church, Peyton was sure that he felt the floor tremble slightly beneath her feet. If she were any bigger, she&#x2019;d have to enter sideways; that, or they&#x2019;d be forced to widen the aisles.<br> <br>And so, the first Sunday after she&#x2019;d returned to the parental home, she had entered the chapel with her mom and dad and Peyton had found himself staring in appalled fascination at her ass, jiggling under a red-and-white floral dress like an earthquake in a rose garden. His jaw might even have been hanging open when he turned to find Artie Hoyt glaring at him, and after that, well, things had never been quite the same between them. They hadn&#x2019;t been close before the incident, but at least they&#x2019;d been civil when their paths had crossed. Now they rarely exchanged even a nod of greeting, and they hadn&#x2019;t spoken to each other until fate, and the missing Faraday boy, had forced them together. They&#x2019;d been part of a group of eight that had started out in the morning, quickly falling to six after old Blackwell and his wife seemed set to pass out and had, reluctantly, turned back for home, then five, four, three, until now it was just Artie and him.<br> <br>Peyton didn&#x2019;t understand at first why Artie didn&#x2019;t just give up and go home himself. Even the modest pace that Peyton and Molly were setting seemed too much for him, and they had been forced to stop repeatedly to allow Artie to catch his breath and gulp water from the bottle that he was carrying in his rucksack. It had taken Peyton a while to figure out that Artie wasn&#x2019;t going to give him the satisfaction of knowing that he&#x2019;d kept searching while Artie had faded, even if the other man were to die in the attempt. With that in mind, Peyton had taken a malicious pleasure in forcing the pace for a time, until he acknowledged that his needless cruelty was rendering null and void his earlier efforts at worship and penitence, the occasional glance at young women notwithstanding.<br> <br>They were nearing the boundary fence between this property and the next, a field of fallow, overgrown land with a small pond at its center sheltered by trees and rushes. Peyton had only a little water left, and Molly was thirsty. He figured he could water her at the pond, then call it a day. He couldn&#x2019;t see Artie objecting, just as long as it was Peyton who suggested quitting, and not him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s head into the field there and check it out,&#x201d; said Peyton. &#x201c;I need to get water for the dog anyway. After that, we can cut back onto the road and take an easy walk back to the cars.

My heart was thumping so hard I thought Oleg might be able to hear it in the passenger seat.<br> <br>&#x201c;You okay?&#x201d; he asked in that flat, stiff English of his.<br> <br>&#x201c;Totally,&#x201d; I lied.<br> <br>The air was chilly for early April, but the morning was unusually bright. The year was 2008, nearly two decades after the Berlin Wall tumbled and the Cold War was consigned to the history books. The Jeep was a black-on-black SRT8 6.1-liter Hemi V8 with 425 horsepower and all the subtlety of a cinder block through a giant plate of glass.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d been waiting for this day for almost two years. Ted and Terry, my FBI handlers, had been gaming it out with me for nearly six months. What would I say when Oleg asked how much money I wanted? What would I do if he pulled out a gun? Lately, things between us had grown unusually tense. The agents had done what they could to prepare me. But all along they kept telling me, &#x201c;You have to be ready to think on your feet.&#x201d;<br> <br>What the hell did that mean? Think about what?<br> <br>As I eased the Jeep to a stop in front of the old brick building, Oleg was staring straight at me. I knew this was a big day for him as well. The documents I&#x2019;d promised, cockpit manuals for two of the U.S. Navy&#x2019;s most important combat aircraft, weren&#x2019;t classified TOP SECRET. But you couldn&#x2019;t just buy them on Amazon or eBay. These were the technical operating procedures that American pilots relied on in Iraq and Afghanistan. These two fat, blue three-ring binders told you everything you needed to know in the pilot&#x2019;s seat.<br> <br>A handoff like this one, I knew, would inspire Oleg&#x2019;s Russian imagination. But it would do more than that. It would help convince his bureaucratic superiors in Moscow that he had recruited a potentially valuable mole in New York, a well-placed American civilian capable of delivering U.S. military data. I was the kind of American asset the secret-hungry Russians searched for, someone with the motivation and the technical expertise to deliver the goods.<br> <br>&#x201c;We make an excellent team, you and me,&#x201d; Oleg said.<br> <br>The binders were inside a large cardboard box in the trunk of my other car, a black Corvette Z06, which was parked inside this huge auto-storage warehouse on a quiet back street in suburban Westchester County, twenty miles north of New York City. The box was too heavy to drag into a restaurant or a coffee shop, which was where Oleg and I usually met. So he and I came up with an alternate plan. He would take the Metro-North train from Grand Central. I&#x2019;d meet him at the station in Hastings-on-Hudson. The warehouse was down by the water, two blocks away.<br> <br>&#x201c;You could make a lot of money,&#x201d; Oleg said as I keyed my PIN into the security keypad outside the warehouse and the metal slats groaned up.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s a lot?&#x201d; I asked him.<br> <br>&#x201c;That Corvette you are so proud of?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What about it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You could buy ten.&#x201d;<br> <br>I did love fast American cars.<br> <br>As I pulled the Jeep inside, the warehouse was chilly and dark. But once I flipped my headlights on, I could see the rows and rows of parked vehicles. Expensive sports cars covered with monogrammed tarps. A Mustang, a Lotus, a Porsche, various Benzes and BMWs&#x2014;the weekend cars of affluent city people. There was also a giant dump truck and a couple of vintage fire engines. Even in this light, I could tell the fire engines were gleaming red.<br> <br>The warehouse was deathly quiet. As far as I could tell, Oleg and I were the only people around.<br> <br>As I drove deeper inside, Oleg glanced left and right and then behind us. What was he expecting? A dozen FBI agents rushing the Jeep? A spetsnaz special-forces team from the Russian GRU? I understood why he might feel jumpy. I felt jumpy, too. &#x201c;The Corvette is down this row and to the right,&#x201d; I said as calmly as I could. So much was on the line, for Oleg and for me, I couldn&#x2019;t afford to screw anything up.<br> <br>Just then, a horrible squealing sound went off. I gasped, and Oleg froze. It took a second for me to realize where the alarm was coming from. For some reason, the Jeep&#x2019;s radar detector had gotten tripped.<br> <br>I scrambled to quiet it, but the off button wasn&#x2019;t where I thought it should be. Damn, that thing was loud! The noise was designed to be heard over a roaring engine on the interstate with the windows open or the air conditioner on and the audio system blasting. In a closed-up Jeep at three miles an hour in a quiet suburban warehouse, that little sucker really screamed. After a couple of frantic seconds that felt like an hour and a half, I found the right button. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; I said to Oleg. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s only my radar detector.&#x201d;<br> <br>I wasn&#x2019;t sure what had made the device go crazy. Maybe my hidden recorder had set it off somehow. Maybe Oleg had something on him. I didn&#x2019;t know. I just didn&#x2019;t want anything spooking him.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re right up here,&#x201d; I said, relieved to be in silence again.<br> <br>Getting my hands on the cockpit manuals wasn&#x2019;t nearly as difficult as I&#x2019;d expected. All it took was a ride to Long Island and a couple of well-crafted lies. Ted and Terry drove me to the office of a major defense contractor and sent me inside alone. I told the friendly clerk I was a researcher with a small tech company preparing a digital database system, and I needed some test documents. The only question was what I wanted.<br> <br>NATOPS, the blue binders said. Naval Air Training and Operating Procedures Standardization. &#x201c;You wanna catch a spy, you gotta do a little spying,&#x201d; Terry said with a shrug as we drove back to the city that day.<br> <br>Now I was about to hand them directly to Oleg, who was finally breathing steadily once more. I parked the Jeep behind the black Corvette, pulling in at a careful angle.<br> <br>&#x201c;Before we start,&#x201d; Oleg said, &#x201c;can you turn off your phone, please?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My phone?&#x201d; I answered. &#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;<br> <br>He&#x2019;d never asked me to do that. I knew he was worried I was recording him with my cell phone. He was right that I was recording him, just wrong about how. So I didn&#x2019;t only turn the phone off. I opened my door. I quickly scanned the area, making sure no one was around. And I set the phone on the hood of a sleek black BMW M6 parked next to us.<br> <br>&#x201c;Better?&#x201d; I asked Oleg.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>I had passed that test.<br> <br>&#x201c;You wanna have a look?&#x201d; I asked him. Oleg stepped out of the Jeep and stood next to me behind the Corvette. I opened the trunk. The cockpit manuals were just where I&#x2019;d left them.<br> <br>Oleg stared for a moment. Then he picked up the manuals, confirming that both of them were there. One was for the F-14 Tomcat fighter jet. The other was for the E-2 Hawkeye early-warning aircraft.<br> <br>Oleg concentrated first on the F-14 binder. As he flipped through the pages, I glimpsed a sketch of the fighter jet&#x2019;s instrument panel. I saw several schematic diagrams and other charts and graphs. There were drawings and blocks of dense gray type. Oleg stared intently, looking almost transfixed.<br> <br>&#x201c;You wanna sit in the Jeep and have a closer look?&#x201d; I asked him.<br> <br>He nodded.<br> <br>I lifted the big cardboard box from the Corvette trunk and placed it on the concrete. Then I reached with my right hand to close the trunk.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t know what I was thinking. Obviously, I wasn&#x2019;t thinking at all. Or at least I wasn&#x2019;t paying attention to the precise location of Oleg&#x2019;s head.<br> <br>&#x201c;Awwwww!&#x201d; he screamed.<br> <br>Somehow I&#x2019;d managed to slam the trunk on the back of Oleg&#x2019;s skull. I heard a horrible clunk as the metal hit bone, and then two more very loud screams. &#x201c;Owww! Eewwww!&#x201d;<br> <br>It all happened so quickly, I didn&#x2019;t know what to think.<br> <br>I knew I&#x2019;d done something profoundly stupid. I had done it at the worst possible time. Just as Oleg and I were moving together from covert to operational. Just as the noose was settling around his neck. Just as I was convincing him that he could really trust me. Just as I was proving what a valuable asset I could be. We were taking this leap together into espionage&#x2014;and I&#x2019;d slammed the damn trunk on his head.<br> <br>As I leaned over to check how badly I had hurt him, terrible thoughts were racing through my head.<br> <br>I had just blown the whole operation. I had maimed a senior Russian diplomat. Certainly, he would think I was trying to kill him. It was all being recorded. Would Oleg be convinced he should never do business with the likes of me again?<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>For three nerve-wracking years, I spied on America for the Russians, trading thumb drives of sensitive technical data for envelopes of cash, selling out my own beloved country across noisy restaurant tables and in quiet parking lots.<br> <br>Or so the Russians believed.<br> <br>In fact, I was a secret double agent working closely with the FBI. The Cold War wasn&#x2019;t really over. It had just gone high-tech.<br> <br>I had no previous experience as a counterespionage operative. Everything I knew about undercover work I&#x2019;d learned from books, movies, school assignments, and Magnum P.I. episodes. Ronin, Spy Game, anything with Bond or Bourne in the title&#x2014;I devoured that stuff. I was in my late twenties by then, a bright but aimless New York University graduate, working in a family business with my immigrant parents, trying to figure out what to do with my life. I had a nice apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, a young wife freshly out of grad school, and a tendency to spend way too much time in front of computer screens. I&#x2019;d read a bunch of books about the Cold War and the Soviet Union, and I&#x2019;d seen almost every war movie ever made. But I didn&#x2019;t speak Russian. I never liked borscht. And the closest I&#x2019;d gotten to Moscow or St. Petersburg was a medium-priced bottle of Stolichnaya from International Wine &amp; Spirits on Broadway and 113th Street. I certainly didn&#x2019;t fit anyone&#x2019;s stereotype of a smooth double agent.<br> <br>Jamali, Naveed Jamali? Don&#x2019;t make me laugh!<br> <br>And yet there I was, at the center of a long-running counter�espionage operation that I cooked up mostly on my own (thanks to an unusual family connection), then convinced the FBI and the Russians to go along. It was proactive, not reactive&#x2014;and I was the active one. Looking back, I can hardly believe I pulled it off. How I did it, why it worked, and what I learned about my country, my family, and myself&#x2014;that&#x2019;s a story I want to tell.<br> <br>By the time we were finished, we had cast a bright light on an active espionage campaign operating out of the Russian Mission to the United Nations in New York. We had suckered an experienced Russian military-intelligence officer into trusting a young American amateur, embarrassing him and his nation. We had earned a solid American win in the escalating hostilities between Moscow and Washington. And we had helped to disprove, for those who had any doubt, the supposedly benign intentions of Russia&#x2019;s post&#x2013;Cold War leaders, Vladimir Putin especially, who kept telling America how much they wanted to be our partners and our friends.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>I apologized profusely to Oleg that day in the storage garage. &#x201c;Oh my God,&#x201d; I said when he finally looked up. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry!&#x201d;<br> <br>He seemed dazed but alert. &#x201c;Are you all right?&#x201d; I asked, putting my hand on his shoulder.<br> <br>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I have a very hard head.&#x201d; Then he flashed a faint smile. &#x201c;A hard head,&#x201d; he repeated.<br> <br>It was a lame joke, in Russian or in English, but a welcome one. I was relieved that Oleg was conscious enough to deliver it. I knew right then that he and I had crossed a crucial line. Despite my squealing radar detector, my clumsy trunk slam, and my amateur&#x2019;s nerves, Oleg wanted me as much as much as I wanted him. Even more so. By the time we left the warehouse, I had an envelope of Oleg&#x2019;s cash inside my jacket pocket. I&#x2019;d fed him a story he could validate from the outside. I had solidified his personal confidence.<br> <br>The experienced Russian military man was convinced he could trust the young American amateur. He would not turn back. He did not want to. He was persuaded that I was for real. Oleg wasn&#x2019;t letting anything, including a trunk lid to his hard skull, divert the two of us from where we were headed next.</p><h2>The Life of General Francis Marion: A Celebrated Partisan Officer, in the Revolutionary War, Against the British and Tories in South Carolina and Geo</h2><p><p>After the fall of Charleston during the American Revolution, South Carolina was devoid of any organized resistance to the British army. It was under these circumstances that Francis Marion organized his famous band of partisans. They resorted to hit-and-run tactics, operating out of the impenetrable swamps of the region. Every man and boy who joined Marion's force was a volunteer. Everyone furnished his own clothing and weapons. When Marion issued a call, his men left their farms and reported with arms in hand. Under Marion's clever direction, the band eluded British general Banastre Tarleton so frequently that he was recalled by Cornwallis. As Tarleton left, he remarked, "As for this damned old fox, the devil himself could not catch him." The nickname "Swamp Fox" stuck with Marion from then on. After the war, those who knew of Marion's exploits pressured Peter Horry, one of Marion's closest friends and an officer in his brigade, to write a biography of the hero. Horry later sent his manuscript to Mason L. "Parson" Weems, who had gained fame for his publication of&nbsp;<em>The Life of Washington</em>. Just as he had evoked poetic license with the story of young Washington chopping down a cherry tree, Weems took liberties to spice up Marion's story. Horry therefore disassociated himself from the book when it was published in 1824. William Gilmore Simms, who wrote a later biography of Marion, described Weems's efforts: "Weems had rather loose notions of the privileges of the biographer, though in reality, he has transgressed much less in his&nbsp;<em>Life of Marion</em>&nbsp;than I generally supposed. But the untamed, and sometimes extravagant exuberance, of his style might well subject his narrative to suspicion." Recently, Hollywood has shown renewed interest in the life of the Swamp Fox, so it seems only appropriate that the first biography of this true American hero be made easily accessible once again. Marion's daring, cunning, and adventuresome spirit still inspire admiration over 200 years later. And although Weems may have taken some liberties with the facts, he sure tells a whopping good story.</p></p><p><p>From the&nbsp;South Carolina Hall of Fame: Peter Horry was born in South Carolina in 1743. In the late 1760s, Horry became a partner of Anthony Bonneau in the Georgetown mercantile firm of Bonneau &amp; Horry but did not pursue a mercantile career. Instead, he became a planter and owned three plantations and 116 slaves.&nbsp; Active in the military during the American Revolution, Horry was a captain in the Second Regiment and was present at the Battle of Fort Moultrie. He was in command of the Fifth Regiments by 1780, after being promoted to major and then colonel. Uniting with Francis Marion in S.C.&#x2019;s lowcountry, Horry commanded a regiment of light horse and was at the Battle of Quinby Bridge.&nbsp; Marion and Horry later preserved an important supply route together. After many years, Horry wrote a history of Marion&#x2019;s Brigade and sent the manuscript for possible publication. Although Horry instructed it to be edited for style only, the editor fictionalized the manuscript and published it as <em>Life of Marion</em>. Horry disclaimed authorship of the distorted work.</p>&nbsp; <p>Weems was born on October 11, 1759, in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. He studied theology in London and was ordained in the Protestant Episcopal Church in 1784. He worked as a minister in Maryland in various capacities from 1784 to 1792. Financial hardship forced Weems to seek additional employment, and he began working as a traveling book agent. Weems married Frances Ewell in 1795 and established a household in Dumfries, Virginia. He had a small bookstore in Dumfries that now houses the Weems&#x2013;Botts Museum, but he continued to travel extensively, selling books and preaching. Dumfries is not far from Pohick Church, part of Truro Parish, in Lorton, Virginia, where both George Washington and his father Augustine had worshiped in pre-Revolutionary days. Weems would later inflate this Washington connection and promote himself as the former "rector of Mount-Vernon parish".</p> <p>After the death of his father-in-law, Colonel Jessie Ewell (1743 - 1805), Weems assumed the Ewell family estate, Bel Air, located in Prince William County, Virginia, to partially satisfy debts owed to Weems. In 1808, Weems and his family moved into Bel Air, where he lived until his death. While on travel in Beaufort, South Carolina, Weems died on May 23, 1825 of unspecified causes. He is buried at Bel Air.</p></p><h2>At Swim, Two Boys</h2><p>Set against the backdrop of Dublin in 1915, a powerful epic of love, history, and culture revisits a crucial time in Irish history by following two young boys, who meet at the local swimming hole, as they plan a challenging swim to an island in Dublin Bay the following Easter, but their plans coincide with the Easter uprising--a historic rebellion that forever changes Ireland and the lives of these two boys. 40,000 first printing.</p><p>You may have read the hype. Irishman Jamie O'Neill was working as a London hospital porter when his 10-year labor of love, the 200,000-word manuscript of <i>At Swim, Two Boys</i>, written on a laptop during quiet patches at work, was suddenly snapped up for a hefty six-figure advance. For once, the book fully deserves the hype.<p> In the spring of 1915, Jim Mack and "the Doyler," two Dublin boys, make a pact to swim to an island in Dublin Bay the following Easter. By the time they do, Dublin has been consumed by the Easter Uprising, and the boys' friendship has blossomed into love--a love that will in time be overtaken by tragedy. O'Neill's prose, playing merrily with vocabulary, syntax, and idiom, has unsurprisingly drawn comparisons to James Joyce and Samuel Beckett, but in his creation of comic characters (such as Jim's pathetic but irrepressible father) and in the sheer scale of his work, Charles Dickens springs to mind first. But Dickens never wrote a love story between young men as achingly beautiful as this. </p><p> In the character of Anthony MacMurrough, who is haunted by voices as he pursues his illegal and dangerous desire for Dublin boys, O'Neill has created a complex and fascinating center to his novel, rescuing the love story from mawkishness, and allowing a serious meditation on history, politics, and desire. For as Ireland seeks its own future free of British government, so Jim, Doyle, and MacMurrough look back to Sparta to find a way to live. As Dr Scrotes, one of MacMurrough's voices, commands: </p><blockquote>Help these boys build a nation of their own. Ransack the histories for clues to their past. Plunder the literature for words they can speak.</blockquote> In this massive, enthralling, and brilliant debut, Jamie O'Neill has indeed done just that: provided a nation for what Walt Whitman calls, in O'Neill's epigraph, "the love of comrades." <i>--Alan Stewart, Amazon.co.uk</i><b>Jamie O'Neill</b> is the author of two previous novels, <i>Disturbance</i> and <i>Kilbrack, or Who Is Nancy Valentine?</i> He was brought up and educated in Dun Laoghaire, County Dublin, then lived in England, and has now returned to Galway, in Western Ireland. For the past ten years O'Neill worked as a night porter in a London psychiatric institution while writing and researching <i>At Swim, Two Boys.</i></p><h2>The Trusted Advisor</h2><p>The essential "must have" tool for professionals who advise or negotiate with others in today's new economy.<br><br>In today's fast-paced networked economy, professionals must work harder than ever to maintain and improve their business skills and knowledge. But technical mastery of your discipline is not enough, assert world-renowned professional advisors David H. Maister, Charles H. Green, and Robert M. Galford. The key to professional success, they argue, is the ability to earn the trust and confidence of clients. The creation of trust is what earns the right to influence clients; trust is also at the root of client satisfaction and loyalty. The workings of trust are even more critical in the new economy than in the old.<br> <br>Maister, Green, and Galford enrich our understanding of trust -- yet they have also written a deeply practical book. Using their model of "The Trust Equation," they dissect the rational and emotional components of trustworthiness. With precision and clarity, they detail five distinct steps you must take to create a trust-based relationship. Each step -- engage, listen, frame, envision, and commit -- is richly described in distinct chapters. The book is peppered with pragmatic "top ten" lists aimed at improving advisors' effectiveness that can be put to use instantly. It also includes a trust self-diagnostic in the appendix.<br> <br>This immensely readable book will be welcomed by the inexperienced advisor and the most seasoned expert alike. The authors use anecdotes, experiences, and examples -- successes and mistakes, their own and others' -- to great effect. Though they use the professional services advisor/client paradigm throughout the book, their prescriptions have resonance for other trust-reliant situations -- selling, customer relationship management, and internal staff functions like HR and information technology.<br> <br>The result is a <i>tour de force</i> -- brilliant, penetrating, unique. It is essential reading for anyone who must advise, negotiate, or manage complex relationships with others.</p><p>David Maister, Charles Green, and Robert Galford--consultants on professional-service management and customer-relation issues--believe nobody can become successful as a business guru until they first gain the confidence of their clients. In <i>The Trusted Advisor</i>, the authors effectively build their case through anecdote and illustration, then relay a solid series of relevant suggestions applicable to both would-be consultants and those already active in the field. Among their most potent suggestions is a practical, five-step development process that encourages outsiders to engage clients by focusing attention on the issues and individuals at hand; listening both to what they say and what they leave unsaid; framing the immediate problem from their perspective; envisioning with them how a solution might appear; and committing jointly to the actions and resources that will bring it about. Also particularly useful is the examination of trust-building during four phases of a client-advisor alliance: at the time the relationship is consummated; during the assignment; after the assignment; and when "cross-selling," or establishing affiliations with the customer's associates. Boosting its utility, the book is filled with concise, easily adopted tips like "return phone calls unbelievably fast" and "always tell the truth and not what the client wants to hear." --<i>Howard Rothman</i>David H.

Chicago Tribune.<br>For eight glorious years, Naomi Judd and daughter Wynonna lived the American dream. Signed by RCA in 1983 after a rare live audition, they became country music's most honored and successful women -- winning six Grammys and selling more than fifteen million albums.<br>Then the discovery of a life-threatening liver disease forced Naomi to retire. The Farewell tour of the Judds broke America's heart and ended one of the most beloved country music acts of all time.<br>But Naomi never gave up. And here, at last, is her story, as touching as any of her songs: the true story of a mother and daughter who sang like angels and fought like devils, but loved each other through struggle, tragedy and triumph.</p><p><p>Country music superstar, Naomi Judd's songs are known and loved around the world. Naomi and her daughter Wynonna came to fame as the wildly popular country music duo The Judds. They have won multiple Grammy and American Music Awards. One of their most awarded songs, "Love Can Build a Bridge," is also the title of Naomi's first book and tape for children. Naomi lives in a rural valley outside of Nashville, TN, which she shares with her manager husband Larry, Wynonna and her children Elijah and Grace, and actress daughter Ashley.</p>This program is the autobiography of country-singing Mom, Naomi Judd, and her daughters, Ashley Ciminella and Wynonna Judd. While Naomi has had her share of problems, her faith, family, music and dedication to health have sustained her. Naomi recounts her life with high spirits and a delightful country twang. Her zest is occasionally overbearing as she exaggerates words and phrases. The wholesome effect resounds with energy which is evident in both the text and Naomi&#39;s vocalization. The program will delight country music fans. It also holds plenty of entertainment value for people who simply enjoy biographies. D.W.K.

It is a profoundly rich, subtly delineated series of sketches of self and others (among the latter, internationally famous British actors such as Gielgud and Richardson). With an Introduction by Piers Paul Read.Already a bestseller in England, Guinness's memoir is less autobiography than fond recollections of the many friends ("blessings") he has accumulated in his long theatrical career. In loosely organized chapters, most centered around one of the major influences in his life (e.g., Sybil Thorndike, John Gielgud), Guinness wanders back and forth through time. The threads of Guinness's own career, marriage, and religious searching wind through these chapters in an amusingly self-deprecatory way. He describes his career as a naval officer during World War II as "the best performance I have given," in a chapter full of hilarious and hair-raising episodes. Sharp imagery and marvelous word portraits make this a charming book of English theatrical lore. Marcia L.

He argues that by relating to God as the heart of tenderness, we can begin to develop a spiritual life that lets go of worry, stops organizing everything as means to an end, and begins to live fully in the awareness of God&#x2019;s infinite grace and mercy in each moment. By accepting the tenderness of God, our hearts will begin to open, our minds can discern truth, and we can more readily see the divine in others.<br> <br> Manning calls into question the prevailing vision of God as a remote overlord who alternately purveys judgment and blessings to his creatures below. He shows how this distorted image of God leads to a spirituality that is shallow and how it is ultimately in conflict with the message of the Gospel.<br> <br> Rooted in his compelling grasp of God as a loving parent, Manning gently invites us to embrace the unfathomable mercy, grace, and love of God.

Emotional isolation. Self-loathing. Immaturity.

My attempt has been [constantly] to reeducate myself, to learn more about the complexities of meaning and the innumerable alternative possibilities that present themselves to the student of Shakespeare. Above all, I have tried to learn how to improve accessibility and clarity for today&#x2019;s reader in the interpretation of this extraordinary body of dramatic literature.<br> My hope is that the sixth edition offers students and general readers the most accessible and usable Shakespeare anthology on the market.&#x201d;</p> <br> <p>Surely one of today&#x2019;s premier Shakespeare scholars, David Bevington is also an extraordinary teacher whose concern is always how to make these remarkable plays compelling for every reader. Bevington&#x2019;s work addresses the primary problems most of us have with reading Shakespeare&#x2013;an unfamiliarity both with the historical period and with the challenging language&#x2013;by providing a comprehensive General Introduction that offers wide-ranging historical, cultural, and critical context for our reading, as well as clear, accessible, line-by-line glosses for the sometimes bewildering Elizabethan language and idioms. At a time when many of us come to Shakespeare by way of film, Bevington brings us back to the wonder of the words. </p> <p>Also available: VangoNotes: How to Study Shakespeare offers a new way to hear and experience Shakespeare&#x2019;s language through downloadable podcasts.</p> <p> Visit us at www.pearsonhighered.com</p></p><h2>Spooky Action at a Distance: The Phenomenon That Reimagines Space and Time--and What It Means for Black Holes, the Big Bang, and Theories of Everything</h2><p><p><b>Long-listed</b><b> for the</b><b> 2016 PEN/E.

It isn't a question that most of us normally ask. Space is the venue of physics; it's where things exist, where they move and take shape. Yet over the past few decades, physicists have discovered a phenomenon that operates outside the confines of space and time: nonlocality-the ability of two particles to act in harmony no matter how far apart they may be. It appears to be almost magical. Einstein grappled with this oddity and couldn't come to terms with it, describing it as "spooky action at a distance." More recently, the mystery has deepened as other forms of nonlocality have been uncovered. This strange occurrence, which has direct connections to black holes, particle collisions, and even the workings of gravity, holds the potential to undermine our most basic understandings of physical reality. If space isn't what we thought it was, then what is it?<br> In <i>Spooky Action at a Distance</i>, George Musser sets out to answer that question, offering a provocative exploration of nonlocality and a celebration of the scientists who are trying to explain it. Musser guides us on an epic journey into the lives of experimental physicists observing particles acting in tandem, astronomers finding galaxies that look statistically identical, and cosmologists hoping to unravel the paradoxes surrounding the big bang. He traces the often contentious debates over nonlocality through major discoveries and disruptions of the twentieth century and shows how scientists faced with the same undisputed experimental evidence develop wildly different explanations for that evidence. Their conclusions challenge our understanding of not only space and time but also the origins of the universe-and they suggest a new grand unified theory of physics. Delightfully readable, <i>Spooky Action at a Distance </i>is a mind-bending voyage to the frontiers of modern physics that will change the way we think about reality.</p></p><p>George Musser is an award-winning journalist, a contributing editor for <i>Scientific American</i>, and the author of <i>The Complete Idiot's Guide to String Theory</i>.

He began carrying a notebook in which he kept some of the details related to the different stories. The joy he found in retelling those myths continued when he discovered other stories. According to Gerald Morris, &#x201c;I never lost my love of retelling the old stories. When I found Arthurian literature, years later, I knew at once that I wanted to retell those grand tales. So I pulled out my notebook . . . I retell the tales, peopling them with characters that I at least find easier to recognize, and let the magic of the Arthurian tradition go where it will.&#x201d; Gerald Morris lives in Wausau, Wisconsin, with his wife and their three children. In addition to writing he serves as a minister in a church.<b>Chapter 1 The Knight with Two Swords </b><p></p> On a day some twenty years after these events, King Arthur held court. Now, most people know that King Arthur became king by drawing an enchanted sword from a stone. Many also know that he established a band of noble heroes called the Knights of the Round Table. Some even know that he ruled wisely and well and brought peace to all England. But not many realize how long all this took. On this particular day, the king had already drawn the sword from the stone, but he had no Round Table and only a few knights, and he ruled only a small part of England. Many powerful nobles were waging war with him, resisting his reign, which kept King Arthur quite busy. Nevertheless, he was already trying to rule wisely and well, which was why he was holding court. He was hearing the appeals of the people and administering justice. <b><p></p> </b>"Next case!" called Sir Kay, the king&#x2019;s foster brother, who stood beside the throne, sorting out the crowd and keeping order. Two guards led forward a grimy knight in dusty armor. Sir Kay looked at his list. "Here, O king, we have a knight who is accused of killing a fellow knight, a certain&#x2014;" Sir Kay paused, squinting at the records in front of him. "Oh, dear." <b><p></p> </b>"What is it, Kay?" asked the king. <b><p></p> </b>"He&#x2019;s accused of killing our cousin, Sir Bullevere. Uncle Clovis&#x2019;s son." <b><p></p> </b>King Arthur said, "This is a serious charge, O knight." He looked disapprovingly at the knight&#x2019;s dusty armor. "Though you don&#x2019;t seem to take it seriously. Is this how you choose to appear before your king?" <b><p></p> </b>The knight replied softly, "I did not choose this dirt, sire. I have spent the last three months in your dungeons, waiting for trial. Your dungeons could use a wash." <b><p></p> </b>The king&#x2019;s expression softened. "I see. I&#x2019;m afraid it <i>has</i> been a while since I last held court, hasn&#x2019;t it? You see, I&#x2019;ve been busy lately, fighting the rebel King Royns of Wales. Well, never mind the dust, then. What is your name?" <b><p></p> </b>"I am Sir Balin of Northumberland, Your Highness," said the knight. <b><p></p> </b>"Sir Balin, you are accused of killing the knight Sir Bullevere." <b><p></p> </b>"Yes, I did that." <b><p></p> </b>King Arthur blinked. "You admit it?" Sir Balin nodded. "Why did you do it?" <b><p></p> </b>"He attacked me." <b><p></p> </b>"Unprovoked?" <b><p></p> </b>"No, sire. I think he attacked me because I called him a nasty, cowardly brute." <b><p></p> </b>King Arthur frowned again. "To provoke another to attack is the same as attacking yourself," he said. <b><p></p> </b>Beside the king, Sir Kay cleared his throat. "Um, Arthur?" <b><p></p> </b>"Yes, Kay?" <b><p></p> </b>"I&#x2019;d just like to point out that, in fact, Bullevere<i> was</i> a nasty, cowardly brute. I mean, remember that Christmas we spent at Uncle Clovis&#x2019;s? Bull was a stinker, all right." <b><p></p> </b>"But you can&#x2019;t just go around calling people names," the king said. <b><p></p> </b>"Even if they&#x2019;re true?" asked Sir Kay. "Why not?" <b><p></p> </b>"Because it starts fights, and people get killed," King Arthur explained patiently. "Sir Balin, step forward to receive your sentence." <b><p></p> </b>But before Sir Balin could move, a murmur arose from the onlookers. The crowd parted to make way for a tall woman, who strode forward wearing a long sword. <b><p></p> </b>"Where is King Arthur?" demanded the woman austerely. <b><p></p> </b>No one spoke. Since King Arthur was wearing a crown and sitting on a throne in the middle of the hall, this seemed rather obvious, and people hate answering silly questions. But the woman apparently expected an answer, so at last the king waved his hand and said, "Um, right here." <b><p></p> </b>"At last! Long have I sought you!" <b><p></p> </b>There was another pause. "Well, ah . . . here I am." <b><p></p> </b>"I am Lady Lyla of the Outer Isles! I bring this enchanted sword, seeking the one knight who is able to draw it from its sheath!" <b><p></p> </b>"Stuck, is it?" asked Sir Kay. <b><p></p> </b>"I used to have a sword that would do that," said another knight. "Have you tried jiggling the hilt?" <b><p></p> </b>"No, you need to tap it on the side," said another. <b><p></p> </b>"Bacon grease," added a third. "That&#x2019;s the best way to&#x2014;" <b><p></p> </b>"It is <i>not</i> stuck!" said the woman. "It is enchanted! Only the noblest knight in England may draw this blade, and for that knight it will come forth easily." <b><p></p> </b>"Oh!" said all the king&#x2019;s knights. <b><p></p> </b>"It&#x2019;s like your sword, Excalibur," Sir Kay said to the king. "No one but you could draw it from the stone. You&#x2019;d better take this, sire." <b><p></p> </b>"Very well," said King Arthur. He rose from his throne and went to Lady Lyla. She held the scabbard firmly in both hands as the king grasped the sword&#x2019;s hilt and pulled. The sword didn&#x2019;t move. The king frowned and tugged again, with the same result. <b><p></p> </b>"Pulling harder will avail you nothing," declared Lady Lyla. "Only the noblest knight in England may draw this blade, and for that knight it will come forth easily." <b><p></p> </b>"Yes, you mentioned that," muttered the king. "Give it a go, Kay?" <b><p></p> </b>One by one, all Arthur&#x2019;s knights tried the sword, but none could budge it by a hair. "Alas!" cried Lady Lyla. "Where shall I find the noblest knight in England?" <b><p></p> </b>Suddenly a strange knight stepped from the crowd. "Let me try!" he said. <b><p></p> </b>"Who are you, O knight?" asked Lady Lyla. <b><p></p> </b>"I am Sir Lanceor of Ireland. I have come to join King Arthur and to prove myself to him! May I attempt the adventure of the enchanted blade?" <b><p></p> </b>Lady Lyla released the sword&#x2019;s sheath, letting it hang loosely by her side. "Any knight may try," she said. <b><p></p> </b>Sir Lanceor struck a dramatic pose, lifted his chin, and said, "I know not whether I am the noblest knight in England, but I am willing to put myself to the test. Shall I, peradventure, succeed where so many noble knights have essayed this trial and . . . ?" <b><p></p> </b>While Sir Lanceor was delivering this speech, the dusty knight Sir Balin stepped up behind Lady Lyla and easily drew the sword from its scabbard. Everyone stared, except for Sir Lanceor, who was too busy talking. " . . . t&#x2019;would be a marvel indeed for an unknown knight to step so quickly to so high a rank, but&#x2014;" <b><p></p> </b>"What do you think you&#x2019;re doing?" demanded Lady Lyla to Sir Balin. Her face was alarmingly purple. <b><p></p> </b>"Drawing the enchanted sword," Sir Balin explained. "You see, when I was born, the Old Woman of the Mountain prophesied that one day I would be the noblest knight in England, so when you said&#x2014;" <b><p></p> </b>"I don&#x2019;t care what some old wench said to you," snarled Lady Lyla. "Give it back!" <b><p></p> </b>"No," said Sir Balin. "It&#x2019;s mine now. I drew it. King Arthur got to keep Excalibur when he drew it from the stone, didn&#x2019;t he?" <b><p></p> </b>"That&#x2019;s true," said Sir Kay. <b><p></p> </b>"Give it to me!" Lady Lyla shrieked. "If you don&#x2019;t return it at once, terrible misfortune will follow you wherever you go!" <b><p></p> </b>Sir Balin shrugged. "Yes, I know. Can I have the scabbard, too?" <b><p></p> </b>With a scream of fury, Lady Lyla threw herself at Sir Balin, but as it happened, Sir Balin had just lowered the sword to examine an odd notch in the blade near the hilt, and Lady Lyla threw herself right onto the point. It pierced her heart, and she fell dead at Sir Balin&#x2019;s feet. <b><p></p> </b>"Oh, dear," said Sir Balin. He glanced at the king. "That was an accident, sire." <b><p></p> </b>"I know," said the king. "I was watching. Bad luck for her, though." <b><p></p> </b>Sir Balin sighed. "It&#x2019;s that prophecy again." <b><p></p> </b>"What prophecy?" asked the king. <b><p></p> </b>"The same one that said I would be known as the noblest knight in England," Sir Balin said. "It also said I would bring misfortune everywhere I went. It&#x2019;s true. Things always go badly for me. It&#x2019;s like when I met your cousin Sir Bullevere. He was beating a peasant with a switch for not getting out of his way, and I only meant to stop him from being such a beast, but then he attacked and I ended up killing him and spending the whole summer in your dungeons. Things always go sour around me." <b><p></p> </b>"I see," said the king. <b><p></p> </b>"So, unless you want to throw me back in your dungeons&#x2014;" <b><p></p> </b>"I don&#x2019;t," said the king. <b><p></p> </b>"&#x2014;then probably the best thing I could do for your court is get far away so none of my ill luck rubs off on you. May I?" <b><p></p> </b>"You may do whatever you wish, Sir Balin. You are free." <b><p></p> </b>"Free? Hardly," muttered Sir Balin. Stooping, he took the scabbard from Lady Lyla&#x2019;s body. <b><p></p> </b>"Here, don&#x2019;t I get a try, too?" asked a plaintive voice. It was Sir Lanceor. <b><p></p> </b>King Arthur raised one eyebrow. "Why? Lady Lyla said only one knight could do it, and one knight has done it." <b><p></p> </b>Sir Lanceor started to speak, then clamped his lips shut and stomped away. <b><p></p> </b>Sir Balin turned to leave, but Sir Kay said, "Just a moment, Sir Balin. It says in the records that you had a horse and a sword when you were arrested. I&#x2019;ve sent for them." <b><p></p> </b>"Thank you," said Sir Balin. <b><p></p> </b>"I guess you have two swords now," said Sir Kay. <b><p></p> </b>Sir Balin sighed heavily. "I&#x2019;ll probably need them."</p><h2>Felidae Pb</h2><p>&#34;The Emergent Manager&#34; examines the process of becoming a manager within organizations and considers how people relate the ways in which they &#39;manage&#39; their lives to their development as managers in the workplace.

As an allegory on Germany's Nazi past, it is facile and ambivalent. The detective/narrator, Francis, an irrepressibly curious house cat, deduces that whoever is murdering the neighborhood tabbys has a warped mind and is attempting to breed a "super race" of felines. After discovering a fanatical cult of self-flagellating felines who worship a martyred cat, Claudandus, Francis is aided by Pascal, a cat who uses a computer, in unearthing another clue--the journal of a half-mad professor who performed sadistic laboratory experiments on cats. The corpses of countless feline victims are thrown into a catacomb guarded by the Persian cat Jesaja, a pathetic dupe who prays both to Yahweh (god of the Hebrews) and to "our blessed Prophet," the murderer, believing that he is doing the Lord's will. Is Pirincci satirizing monotheistic religion, or the alleged passivity of Jews who believed that Hitler would spare them? Such troubling questions are left unanswered. This fable is most effective as an acerbic commentary on humanity's follies, obtuseness and knack for evil. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Soldier&#39;s Way: An Autobiography</h2><p>First UK Edition.

However, it will serve as a steppingstone for those young readers not quite ready for the detailed descriptions and hearty brogues of Brian Jacques's ever popular and endlessly replicating Redwall series.<i>--Jennifer Hubert</i>The island of Mistmantle is inhabited by red squirrels, otters, hedgehogs, and moles and ruled from Mistmantle tower by a hedgehog king.

Mistmantle has always been a free society, but under the influences of a squirrel Captain called Husk, the King is enforcing harsh new laws and the animals are becoming enslaved. Using the traditional system of drawing tokens to establish a person's guilt, Crispin is accused of a terrible murder and is banished from the island. urchin becomes caught up in the struggle to restore justice and freedom to Mistmantle, to overthrow Husk, and return Crispin to the island.<p><i>From the Cassette edition.</i></p></p><h2>Austenland: A Novel</h2><p><p>Jane Hayes is a seemingly normal young New Yorker, but she has a secret. Her obsession with Mr. Darcy, as played by Colin Firth in the BBC adaptation of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>, is ruining her love life: no real man can compare. But when a wealthy relative bequeaths her a trip to an English resort catering to Austen-crazed women, Jane's fantasies of meeting the perfect Regency-era gentleman suddenly become realer than she ever could have imagined. </p><p>Decked out in empire-waist gowns, Jane struggles to master Regency etiquette and flirts with gardeners and gentlemen&#x2015;or maybe even, she suspects, with the actors who are playing them. It's all a game, Jane knows. And yet the longer she stays, the more her insecurities seem to fall away, and the more she wonders: Is she about to kick the Austen obsession for good, or could all her dreams actually culminate in a Mr. Darcy of her own?</p></p><p><p><b>Shannon Hale</b> is the award-winning author of the young adult novels <i>The Goose Girl</i>, <i>Enna Burning</i>, <i>River Secrets</i>, and <i>Princess Academy</i>, a <i>New York Times </i>bestseller and a Newbery Honor Medalist. She is an avid Austen fan and admirer of men in breeches. She lives with her husband and two small children in Salt Lake City, Utah.</p>Well known for writing clever twists on fairy tales for young adults, the author has written her first adult story. Aficionados will connect with the many allusions to Jane Austens works in this modern-day story of 33-year-old Jane Hayes, who is frustrated in love and longing for an Austen-like romance. When her Aunt Carolyn wills her a three-week stay at Pembroke Park, an Austen role-playing theme park, Jane starts by seeking a Mr. Darcy and ends by realizing that her present reality holds more promise than the fictional past. Katherine Kellgren characterizes British-accented gentlemen and women as they indulge in a Regency lifestyle. As Jane, she expresses the passions of a young woman trying to make sense of life and love.

Ian Duncan is desperately in love with the first lady, Nicole Thibideaux, who he has never met. Richard Kongrosian refuses to see anyone because he is convinced his body odor is lethal.

Yeats: A Life I: The Apprentice Mage, 1865-1914</h2><p>William Butler Yeats has cast his long shadow over the history of both modern poetry and modern Ireland for so long that his preeminence is taken for granted. Now, in the first authorized biography of Yeats to appear in over fifty years, leading Irish historian R.F. Foster travels beyond Yeats's towering image as arguably the century's greatest poet to restore a real sense of Yeats's extraordinary life as Yeats himself experienced it--what he saw, what he did, the passions and the petty squabbles that consumed him, and his alchemical ability to transmute the events of his crowded and contradictory life into enduring art.<br> In the first volume of this long-awaited biography, Foster covers the poet's first fifty years, bringing new light to bear on Yeats's heroic and often ruthless efforts to invent himself as a poet and public figure. Drawn from a fascinating archive of personal and contemporary documents with the cooperation of surviving members of the Yeats family, it dramatically alters long-held assumptions about the poet's background, his relationship with Maud Gonne and other women, and his roles in the great cultural and political upheavals that transformed Ireland in his lifetime. A rich and entertaining account of Yeats's boyhood days amidst the talented but troubled members of the Yeats and Pollexfen clans provides important insight into the poet's deep and lifelong connection to the Irish landscape, his early, impassioned embrace of the nationalist cause, and his later retreat to the traditions of the once grand Protestant aristocracy. In his own day Yeats attracted enemies and admirers with equal passion, and Foster vividly recreates the friendships, love affairs, and simmering rivalries that swirled about the poet's circles in London, Dublin, and Coole Park. Complementing his meticulous scholarship with a shrewd wit and a novelist's eye for detail, he chronicles the romantic disappointments, financial difficulties, experimentation with hashish and mescal, and the growing preoccupation with the occult that prefaced Yeats's attempt to unite Irish politics with high culture and his creation of an Irish national theater. Here are the poet's memorable encounters with many of the most interesting people of his time, including Oscar Wilde, George Bernard Shaw, Lady Gregory, J.M. Synge, Ezra Pound, James Joyce, and the wildly diverse leaders of the Irish independence movement. And here at last is a full accounting of the complex bond between Yeats and the incomparable Maud Gonne, revealed as an influence eternally recreated 'like the phoenix,' affecting almost everything he did.<br> Poet, playwright, mystic and revolutionary; lover, confidant, and friend. This brilliant account of the public and private lives of William Butler Yeats illuminates not only the wellspring of his artistic vision, but the modern Irish identity he helped to create. It is essential reading for anyone intrigued by one of the most original and influential voices of the twentieth century.</p><p>There are several biographies of the great Irish poet to choose from, and the one you&#39;ll prefer depends on how much biography you want. Subtitled &#34;The Apprentice Mage, 1865-1914,&#34; this is the one for completists (though they&#39;ll have to wait for Volume Two to get through Yeats&#39;s death in 1939). The author, a noted Irish historian, renders Yeats&#39;s life almost day to day, giving a particularly lively sense of the helter-skelter nature of his early years and a nice depiction of his tumultuous engagement with the Abbey Theatre.<br><strong>R.F. Foster</strong> is Carroll Professor of Irish History, Hertford College, Oxford. His books include <em>Modern Ireland 1600-1972, The Oxford Illustrated History of Ireland</em>, and acclaimed biographies of Charles Stewart Parnell and Lord Randolph Churchill.<br></p><h2>Corridors of the Night: A William Monk Novel</h2><p>Anne Perry, that incomparable novelist of life in Victorian England, has once again surpassed herself, with this twenty-first installment of her <i>New York Times</i> bestselling William Monk series.

Even the windows on the wards would be shut at this hour.<br><br>The girl stood motionless. Her eyes were wide, her skin as pale as the nightgown that hung just past her knees. Her legs were matchstick thin and her feet bare and dusty. She looked terrified.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you lost?&#x201d; Hester asked her gently. She could not think what the child was doing here. This was an annex to Greenwich Hospital. It backed onto the Thames, well downriver from the huge Port of London and the teeming city beyond. Did she belong to one of the other nurses, who had sneaked her in rather than leave her alone at home? It was against the rules. Hester would have to make sure no one else found her.<br><br>&#x201c;Please, miss,&#x201d; the child said in a hoarse whisper. &#x201c;Charlie&#x2019;s dying! You gotter come an&#x2019; &#x2019;elp &#x2019;im. Please . . .&#x201d;<br><br>There was no other sound in the night, no footsteps on the stone floors. Dr. Rand would not be on duty until the morning.<br><br>The child&#x2019;s fear vibrated in the air. &#x201c;Please . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where is he?&#x201d; Hester asked quietly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see what I can do.&#x201d;<br><br>The child gulped and took a deep breath. &#x201c; &#x2019;E&#x2019;s this way. I left the door stuck. We can get back, if yer &#x2019;urry. Please . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m coming,&#x201d; Hester agreed. &#x201c;You lead the way. What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maggie.&#x201d; She turned and started to go quickly, her bare feet soundless on the chill floor.<br><br>Hester followed her down the corridor, around a corner, and along another passage even less well lit. She could only just see the small, pale figure ahead of her, glancing backwards every few moments to make sure Hester was still there. They were going away from the wards where sick and badly injured sailors were treated, and farther into administrative areas and storerooms. Hester did not know the hospital well. She had volunteered to do temporary night duty as a favor to Jenny Solway, a friend who had a sudden illness in her own family. They had served together with Florence Nightingale in the Crimea. That was almost fourteen years ago, but the experiences they had shared&#x2014;on fearful battlefields, including Balaclava, and in the hospital in Sebastopol&#x2014;forged their lasting friendship, still strong although they went years without meeting.<br><br>Hester caught up with the child and took her small, cold hand.<br><br>&#x201c;Where are we going?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br>&#x201c;To &#x2019;elp Charlie,&#x201d; Maggie replied without turning her head. She was tugging at Hester now. &#x201c;We gotter &#x2019;urry. Please . . .&#x201d;<br><br>One more turn in the corridor and they reached a door that was flush with the wall and appeared to have no handle. A piece of cotton knotted to make a short rope was wedged to stop the door from closing completely. Maggie let go of Hester&#x2019;s hand, slid her thin fingers under the fabric, and eased the door open.<br><br>&#x201c;Ssh!&#x201d; she warned. Then she stepped sideways through the crack and beckoned for Hester to follow her. When Hester was through also, she replaced the rope and then pushed the door closed again.<br><br>Hester went in a step behind Maggie. They were in another ward, smaller than the ones for the sailors, but holding six cots. The night lamps on the walls showed that there were small forms in three of them, lying still, as if asleep.<br><br>&#x201c;Where are we?&#x201d; Hester whispered.<br><br>&#x201c;This is our place,&#x201d; Maggie replied. &#x201c;Charlie&#x2019;s over there.&#x201d; She took Hester&#x2019;s hand again and pulled her toward the farthest bed near the doorway of the ward. It was closed, and Hester had lost her sense of direction to know even which way it faced.<br><br>Maggie stopped beside the bed, where an ashen-skinned boy about her own size lay propped up against the pillows. He turned toward her very slightly and tried to smile.<br><br>&#x201c;Charlie,&#x201d; Maggie&#x2019;s voice wobbled a little and there were tears on her cheeks, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s going to be all right. I got one o&#x2019; the nurses ter come. She&#x2019;s gonna make yer better.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yer shouldn&#x2019;t a&#x2019; done that,&#x201d; he whispered. &#x201c;Yer&#x2019;ll get into trouble.&#x201d;<br><br>She lifted her chin up a little. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care!&#x201d; She looked at Hester. &#x201c;Yer gotta do summink.&#x201d;<br><br>Hester&#x2019;s heart sank and she felt a moment of panic. The boy looked desperately ill. Maggie was probably right that he was dying. Was this a quarantine ward? How could she hope to get enough information from a young child to have any idea what was wrong with him, or how to help?<br><br>The first thing she needed to do was to reassure him, gain his confidence. She moved forward and stood by the side of the bed.<br><br>&#x201c;Hello, Charlie,&#x201d; she said very quietly. &#x201c;Tell me how you feel. Are you hot? Sick? Shivery? Do you hurt anywhere especially?&#x201d;<br><br>He stared at her for a moment. His face was so pale his skin looked almost translucent, the shadows around his eyes like bruises. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t really &#x2019;urt,&#x201d; he whispered. &#x201c;Just a bit achy.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Have you been sick?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Yesterday.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Very sick, or just a little?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Quite a lot.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Have you eaten anything since then?&#x201d;<br><br>He shook his head.<br><br>&#x201c;Drink anything? Water?&#x201d;<br><br>She reached forward and touched her hand to his forehead. He felt hot and dry. She turned to Maggie, who was staring at her, eyes filled with fear.<br><br>&#x201c;Can you go and fetch Charlie a drink of water, please?&#x201d; Hester asked.<br><br>Maggie started to speak, then changed her mind and went off to obey.<br><br>&#x201c;Please, miss, don&#x2019;t tell &#x2019;er I&#x2019;m dyin&#x2019;,&#x201d; Charlie said almost under his breath. &#x201c;She&#x2019;d be awful upset.&#x201d;<br><br>Hester felt a sudden ache in her throat. She was a nurse&#x2014;she was used to people dying&#x2014;but these children alone, with no parent to comfort them, were different. They were so small, and lost. She did not normally lie to patients; if you did, then sooner or later they stopped believing you, and if that happened, much of the power to help was lost too.<br><br>This was different.<br><br>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t.&#x201d; She made too big a promise, without hesitation. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t intend to let you die if I can help it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But will you look after &#x2019;er?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;An&#x2019; Mike? Please?&#x201d;<br><br>It was not a time for equivocation. &#x201c;Yes, I will. Are you the eldest?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah. I&#x2019;m seven. Maggie&#x2019;s only six, although she acts like she&#x2019;s everybody&#x2019;s ma.&#x201d; He gave a weak smile, a little lopsided.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you know why you&#x2019;re here in hospital?&#x201d; It was time to be practical.<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; He shook his head a fraction. &#x201c;Summink ter do wi&#x2019; me blood.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Are they giving you medicine for it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They keep putting a big needle in me arm. It &#x2019;urts a lot.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Really? Yes, it would hurt. Does this needle have a glass tube on the other end of it?&#x201d; She was picturing the major new invention called a syringe, which could transfer liquids into the flesh&#x2014;or, for that matter, take them out.<br><br>He nodded.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you know what was in the glass part?&#x201d;<br><br>He was looking paler and she could hardly hear his voice when he answered, &#x201c;Looked red, like blood.&#x201d;<br><br>Maggie came back with a mug full of water. Hester thanked her for it, then took a sip. It smelled and tasted fresh. She put an arm around Charlie. She could feel his bones through his nightshirt. She eased him upright and helped him to very slowly drink a little of the water. When he had taken all he could she laid him back down again, then as carefully as possible straightened the sheets around him so they were smooth. He was gasping for breath, exhausted. She looked at him and was very afraid Maggie was right.<br><br>If he died, how was she going to help Maggie, who looked not much stronger herself? It was probably only fear and the need to believe she was doing something to help her brother that kept her upright on her feet, albeit swaying a little. Hester would have suggested the child sleep for a while, but she knew that if Charlie died when she was not there, the guilt would be with Maggie forever. It made no sense, but she would believe that she could have done something. In her place Hester would feel the same.<br><br>&#x201c;How old is Mike?&#x201d; she asked quietly.<br><br>&#x201c;Four,&#x201d; Maggie replied. &#x201c; &#x2019;E&#x2019;s not so bad. Maybe &#x2019;e&#x2019;ll get worse when &#x2019;e&#x2019;s older.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe not. Do they put the needles into him, too?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; She nodded.<br><br>&#x201c;And you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; She nodded again. &#x201c;But mostly Charlie. Can&#x2019;t you do summink, miss?&#x201d;<br><br>Hester still had little idea what was wrong with any of them. A misjudged treatment could be lethal. There was a stage in an illness when there was nothing more anyone could do. A small boy could take only so much &#x201c;treatment.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What is the doctor doing to help him? Tell me all you know, Maggie. I need to do the right thing for him.&#x201d;<br><br>The tears spilled over and ran down Maggie&#x2019;s cheeks. &#x201c; &#x2019;E don&#x2019;t do nothing, miss. &#x2019;E comes and puts a needle into Charlie, an&#x2019; &#x2019;e gets sleepy an&#x2019; sick. &#x2019;E just lies there. Can&#x2019;t even speak ter me an&#x2019; Mike. Please, miss . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Hester knew that Dr. Rand went home at night. After all, everyone had to sleep. But there was supposed to be a senior nurse on duty all night. Where was she? Sometimes there were emergencies that only a doctor could deal with, and a messenger would have to be sent to waken him. But this was a hospital for those who were extremely ill, or so badly wounded that often there was nothing that could be done for them except ease their distress, or at the very least, not leave them to die alone.<br><br>That was all too often what military nursing had been during the Crimean War, not so very long ago. Hemorrhage, gangrene, raging fever&#x2014;these were things she had been used to coping with because scores of men, even hundreds, were wounded in battle. There were too few doctors, and usually too little time. That was one of the reasons the two Rand brothers, Dr. Magnus Rand and his elder brother, a chemist, Hamilton Rand, had been so pleased to have Hester, another Crimea nurse, fill in for Jenny Solway. Her experience was of great value.<br><br>Where on earth was the nurse in charge here? Hester did not dare leave Charlie to look for her. Was she ill herself? Or passed out drunk somewhere? It had been known to happen.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you know what his illness is called?&#x201d; Hester asked Maggie.<br><br>Maggie shook her head no.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you have the same illness?&#x201d; Hester persisted.<br><br>Maggie nodded.<br><br>&#x201c;What does the doctor do for you?&#x201d;<br><br>There was little time. In the bed beside them Charlie was lying motionless, his face white and his breathing shallow. But she had to find out all that Maggie could tell her before she attempted to help.<br><br>&#x201c;Maggie?&#x201d; she prompted.<br><br>&#x201c; &#x2019;E pricked me wi&#x2019; the needle too.&#x201d; She took a deep breath. &#x201c;It hurt something awful.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you know what was in the little bottle at the end of the needle?&#x201d; Hester asked. &#x201c;What color was it?&#x201d;<br><br>Maggie shook her head. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t want ter look, an&#x2019; &#x2019;e told me not ter, but I did, just quickly. I think it were blood.&#x201d;<br><br>Hester felt a chill run through her. So Magnus was taking blood? What for? Was Hamilton Rand testing it for something? He was a brilliant chemist, almost visionary in some ways. What was he learning from these children&#x2019;s blood?<br><br>Maggie was staring at her, waiting, her eyes full of hope.<br><br>&#x201c;Get me another cup of water,&#x201d; Hester said to her. &#x201c;Please.&#x201d;<br><br>Maggie turned and went immediately.<br><br>Hester leaned forward and pushed the sleeve up a little on Charlie&#x2019;s thin arm. She took the skin between her finger and thumb. It lifted away as if there were no flesh over the bone. At least she knew something to start with. &#x201c;When did you last go to a bathroom to pee?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br>Charlie blinked slowly. He seemed a little embarrassed. &#x201c;Long time ago.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Can you let me look inside your mouth? Please?&#x201d; He dropped his jaw obediently. She bent and peered inside. His skin was pale and almost dry, even his tongue. Now she knew at least one thing seriously wrong with him. Dehydration, when it was bad enough, could kill, especially a child as slight as he was. Water might not be all he needed, but it might keep him alive long enough to find a proper solution.<br><br>Maggie came back, running so quickly she almost tripped. She steadied herself without dropping the water, though the mug she carried was full to the brim.<br><br>Hester smiled at her, and very gently lifted Charlie up again so he was cradled in her arms and his head was nearly upright. He opened his eyes, but it was Maggie he looked at. He smiled at her hazily, and then seemed to drift off.<br><br>Hester put the mug to his lips. &#x201c;Drink a little more, Charlie,&#x201d; she urged him. &#x201c;Just a sip.&#x201d;<br><br>For several moments he did not move; then, as he tipped the mug very slightly, he took a mouthful. He swallowed it and coughed. After a few seconds he took another.<br><br>Maggie was staring at them as if she were seeing a miracle. Hester ached with grief for her, because it was almost certainly useless, but she could not bear to tell her so. Her eyes were bright and she was so intent on Charlie, she was hardly remembering to breathe.<br><br>It took half an hour, but sip by sip, Charlie drank all of it. Hester felt a sense of triumph as if she had climbed a mountain. She laid Charlie back in the bed and pulled the blanket up over him again. He lay completely still, and almost straight away he was asleep.<br><br>Maggie&#x2019;s smile was so wide it must have hurt her cheeks. She was too full of emotion to speak. She knew it was only the beginning.<br><br>Hester stayed with them. Mike, the younger brother, was lying quietly and did not do more than stir and turn over when she touched his brow and then his arm. He looked more like three than four, but she knew that poor or sick children were often small for their ages.<br><br>An hour later she woke Charlie and, sip by sip, gave him another glass of water. Maggie helped. She refused to go back to her own bed, even though she was swaying on her feet with exhaustion. She agreed to sit down beside Hester, then at last, somewhere near dawn, she crumpled up and slid onto her lap, sound asleep.<br><br>About an hour later Hester laid Maggie gently into her own bed, and then went to look for the nurse who should have been on duty there.<br><br>She tried all the nearby storerooms and cupboards, rooms with sinks, taps, and places for laundry and rubbish, but there was no sign of her. Either she had not come to work in the first place or she had been and gone again almost straight away. Had she been ill, lazy, or on some emergency of her own? Or simply an assignation? It wouldn&#x2019;t be unheard of.</p><h2>Praying for Sleep</h2><p>Michael Hrubeck, a twenty-eight-year-old man with childlike yearnings, escapes from a hospital for the criminally insane and sets out to find the woman who named him as the Indian Leap State Park murderer. 75,000 first printing. $75,000 ad/promo.

Cataloochee is his first novel.1<br><br>Too Worn Out to Cry<br><br>Ezra Banks sprang from a line of men pretty good at hunting and fishing and gambling and drinking. But at farming they piddled. Tenants. Ezra, third son in a brood of seven, knew early he didn't want to sharecrop. His father farmed ten or twelve hardscrabble acres near Spring Creek in Madison County, North Carolina. The land belonged to Bingham Wright, brother to Jonathan Wright next county over, in Cataloochee. Ezra's father, a bit too old to serve in the Confederate Army, had shown up just after the war started and leased Wright's poorest section. Some pasture was so steep a fellow needed two breeds of cattle, one with short right legs to stand in one direction and pick the thistle-ridden grass, the other with short left legs to pick going the opposite way. On level ground they could lean against each other to sleep.<br><br>In 1864 Ezra looked older than fourteen, lanky, a bit of beard already and a badly bent nose. His father had broken it three years before when they moved to the Wright place. The old man was trying to fix a fence gate. He banged his thumb with the claw hammer and splintered its handle when he flung it at the barn in a rage. He ran to the back porch and yanked a piece from the middle of his wife's stove-wood stack and started to whittle a new handle. As he smoothed it with his rusty hawksbill, the stack dissolved around the missing stick and fell off the porch. He yelled, "Get out here, woman, and pick up yer goddamn firewood before it rains on it."<br><br>Ezra, a boy given to moodiness, had been enlisted to help but had only dragged three tulipwood laps to the stile. He stood ten feet from his father, hands in his pockets, watching him like a cat. The old man held a crosspiece in one hand and a hammer in the other and realized he needed three arms to attach it to the gate. He glared at his son. "You think you're winder decoration? Hold this damn thing for me. Right there." Ezra hastened to the other end of the board. His father struck his last tenpenny nail sidelong, pinging it off the hammer end and scattering a couple of speckled banty hens at the barn entrance. He fumbled in his overalls for another nail. "Don't jist stand there like a sumbitching wooden Indian, boy, fetch me some nails."<br><br>When Ezra said, "Go get them yourself," the old man backhanded the claw hammer with no hesitation. Had Ezra not been quick he would have been dead. The jagged, rusty claw missed his nose but the hammer head's top hit home, spinning him into the dirt. "That'll learn ye to sass me, boy. Now get yer worthless ass up and fetch me them whorehopping nails fore I light into you again."<br><br>Ezra got up slowly, running the back of his hand as close to his nose as pain allowed, making up his mind to leave.<br><br>On a cold November Saturday just after his fourteenth birthday, Ezra saddled the horse, a gaunt, swaybacked strawberry roan, as his father's drunken snores shook the back of the house. He tied his stuff-a piece of a shovel, a clasp knife, a wooden spoon, two shirts and a pair of overalls-in a bedroll back of the ratty saddle. His mother trudged to the barn to give him a pone of corn bread and a leather pouch his old man had hidden behind a hearthstone. He felt coins inside. "Son, will I ever see you again?"<br><br>He faced a woman too worn out to cry. He hugged his mother awkwardly, put on his hat, and said nothing. It would be bad for her when the old bastard finally woke to find neither horse nor saddle. Heading down the mountain he stopped and looked back. No help for it but to forge on.<br><br>The journey spurred his imagination. He rode through the valley and determined one day to own a farm like Bingham Wright's. Acre upon acre of bottomland sprouted corn and oats and anything else a man cared to plant. The valley floor narrowed and the road snaked up the mountain toward Trust, a settlement that seemed glued to the mountainside like an outsized doll village.<br><br>His mother's cousin Fred Owenby kept the general store, and sometimes when things got bad at home Ezra and his brothers and sisters had stayed with him. Owenby had taught him many things, including how to graft one variety of apple to another. He told Ezra to hold his head up, that he needed neither to emulate nor to cower before his father. Owenby made everything a contest, whether hunting supper or picking apples. Ezra didn't stop as he rode by the store but thought one day he would even beat Owenby at growing apples.<br><br>By dinnertime, as he rested the horse at Doggett Gap, he looked at the Little Sandy Valley. It spoke of field crops but the southeast face of Doggett Mountain looked ideal for orchards. Hard to clear, by God, he thought, but once a man gets shed of tulip trees and laurel hells, keeping an orchard's easier than growing tobacco. Besides, the steeper the land, the cheaper the price.<br><br>By evening he had forded the French Broad west of Asheville, at that point a lazy river of not a quarter mile's breadth, determined to join the Confederates. He was no patriot nor did he know anybody rich enough to own other men and women, but adventure appealed to him. He rode carefully, hiding from men riding together, for as the war wound down, the Home Guard had taken to shooting outliers instead of rounding them up for bounty, and he had heard of the Guard killing civilians.<br><br>Asheville was a city of about eleven hundred souls. He rode up the western hill from the river to Public Square and asked where to leave his horse for the night. A man with one eye pointed him to the liveries. He rode the block west to Water Street, which descended quickly to a series of squat wooden buildings smelling of hay and horse manure. The sign dangling by one chain told of cheapest so he left the horse there. The greasy proprietor gave him a wooden token with which to reclaim the animal. Ezra shoved it into his right boot and walked back to the Square. He felt easier when the token worked under his instep.<br><br>Ezra had never seen so many people in one place before, even at the county fair he once sneaked off to. People promenaded the plank Saturday-night sidewalks on Main and Patton. Nine or ten saloons bursting with cheap whiskey and loud music, and several hotels, some more refined than others, opened to the street. Through one doorway Ezra saw a slick-haired man in a monkey suit, playing what Ezra knew to be a fiddle, but a body could never square-dance to such music. He walked up and down, to and fro, eyeing people, feeling the token in his boot, wondering what it cost to enter such places. By midnight he found a watering hole on Eagle Street, where he purchased some foul fluid the barkeeper called whiskey, and the favors of a plain young woman. He was rough with her at first but after she slapped him he learned quickly.<br><br>Sunday morning he prowled the mud streets, peering into shopfronts. He smelled coal smoke, bacon frying, horse manure. From the end of North Main clear to the end of South Main he watched folks emerge from hotels, some hungover and slow, others dressed for church. He turned back up the hill toward the Square, and saw people heading for the courthouse, a three-story brick building on a small rise east of the Square. Ezra in farm clothes and denim overcoat trailed decently dressed people carrying books and speaking quietly. He followed them up the steps into the central of three arched doorways and into a high-ceilinged room. A black-suited old man, smelling of shaving soap and cedar, greeted him icily. Ezra sat on the back bench.<br><br>It was clearly a courtroom but in front of the bench a hand-lettered sign proclaimed, "Welcome to the Asheville Baptist Church William Boland Standing To God Be the Glory." He wondered what kind of church didn't have its own building. A bearded man in a dark broadcloth suit smiled thinly at the assembly. Ezra figured him for Boland. Behind the preacher four fat women wearing faded lapel jewelry and two ancient men in yellowed shirts frowned in splint-bottomed chairs, hymnbooks in laps. They made a bare choir, ruined by war. A pasty- faced woman began to beat a poor rhythm on a piano off to the right. Ezra didn't recognize the tune, but he wasn't much of a churchgoer and she wasn't much of a musician.<br><br>When the piano lady finished, maybe thirty-five souls faced the preacher and watched the choir watch them. The men were few and old save one, a youth with an outsized head and a vacant stare. They made no effort to seat men on one side and women on the other, in the Baptist way. It would have looked lopsided, like a vineyard trimmed by an idiot.<br><br>Boland stood and opened a large Bible. He welcomed the flock, sipped from a glass, and began to read in a mournful tone: " 'And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully: And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits? And he said, This I will do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater: and there I will bestow all my fruits and my goods. And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years: take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry. But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall these things be, which thou hast provided? So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.'<br><br>"The Gospel of Luke, chapter twelve, verses sixteen through twenty- two. Praise God for his holy Word." Why in the world, Ezra wondered, does this bunch on the front side of winter have any truck with some fellow and his barns? They stood for a hymn. Ezra kept his seat, squirming to get comfortable. He felt the beginning of a headache stomp like troops marching to the doleful tune the congregation droned.<br><br>Boland began his sermon by declaring that the rich man stood for the Yankee government. Soon God would turn the tide and require the souls of the Federals. He warmed to his topic, wandering into Paul's letters, quoting texts in First Pet...</p><h2>Natural Alternatives to Antibiotics</h2><p>&#39;A long-awaited book that answers many questions&#39; Jan de Vries When antibiotics were developed in the 1940s, they were hailed as a huge breakthrough in the treatment of bacterial infections. Since then they have become the most commonly prescribed drugs in the world. However, massive over-prescribing is causing increasing problems. The advent of antibiotic-resistant organisms or &#39;superbugs&#39; has more and more people demanding alternatives. Since it was published in 1996 &#39;Alternatives to Antibiotics&#39; has been translated into 16 languages and has been an international bestseller. &#39;Natural Alternatives to Antibiotics &#39; is a revised and updated edition of this important book. Dr John McKenna looks at the various strains of infections which have become resistant since his book was first published. He has expanded his sections on alternative, herbal, homeopathic and nutritional medicines, and shows directly that it is still possible to treat infections without antibiotics while still acknowledging the times that they may be necessary.</p><p>Dr John McKenna has a science degree and a medical degree and has been practising nutritional medicine for over 25 years. He has come out of retirement to set up The Food Clinic which deals with weight loss issues.

Nelson's research created news worldwide when the results were published in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>. After a year of strength training twice a week, women's bodies were 15 to 20 years more youthful. Without drugs, they regained bone, helping to prevent osteoporosis. They became stronger--in most cases even stronger than when they were young. Their balance and flexibility improved. They were leaner and trimmer, without changing what they ate. What's more, the women were so energized, they became 27 percent more active. No other program--whether diet, medication, or aerobic exercise--has ever achieved comparable results.<br><br><i>Strong Women Stay Young</i> shows women how to get the same remarkable benefits at home or in the office, working out just twice a week.

This one is no different, but its well-designed, progressive strength-training promises the fountain of youth in two 40-minute sessions a week. An extravagant claim? Yes. But many women, especially those between age 40 and 80, can achieve certain measures of youth: denser bones, better balance and flexibility, more strength and energy than women years younger.

We face four major challenges on which our future depends, and we are failing to meet them&#x2015;and if we delay any longer, soon it will be too late for us to pass along the American dream to future generations. <br> In <i>That Used to Be Us</i>, Thomas L. Friedman, one of our most influential columnists, and Michael Mandelbaum, one of our leading foreign policy thinkers, offer both a wake-up call and a call to collective action. They analyze the four challenges we face&#x2015;globalization, the revolution in information technology, the nation's chronic deficits, and our pattern of excessive energy consumption&#x2015;and spell out what we need to do <i>now </i>to sustain the American dream and preserve American power in the world. They explain how the end of the Cold War blinded the nation to the need to address these issues seriously, and how China's educational successes, industrial might, and technological prowess remind us of the ways in which "that used to be us." They explain how the paralysis of our political system and the erosion of key American values have made it impossible for us to carry out the policies the country urgently needs. <br> And yet Friedman and Mandelbaum believe that the recovery of American greatness is within reach. They show how America's history, when properly understood, offers a five-part formula for prosperity that will enable us to cope successfully with the challenges we face. They offer vivid profiles of individuals who have not lost sight of the American habits of bold thought and dramatic action. They propose a clear way out of the trap into which the country has fallen, a way that includes the rediscovery of some of our most vital traditions and the creation of a new thirdparty movement to galvanize the country. <br> <i>That Used to Be Us </i>is both a searching exploration of the American condition today and a rousing manifesto for American renewal.</p></p><p><strong>Thomas L.

The answer is simple. We have been friends for more than twenty years, and in that time hardly a week has gone by without our discussing some aspect of international relations and American foreign policy. But in the last couple of years, we started to notice some- thing: Every conversation would begin with foreign policy but end with domestic policy&#x2014;what was happening, or not happening, in the United States. Try as we might to redirect them, the conversations kept coming back to America and our seeming inability today to rise to our greatest challenges.<br>This situation, of course, has enormous foreign policy implications. America plays a huge and, more often than not, constructive role in the world today. But that role depends on the country&#x2019;s social, political, and economic health. And America today is not healthy&#x2014;economically or politically. This book is our effort to explain how we got into that state and how we get out of it.<br>We beg the reader&#x2019;s indulgence with one style issue. At times, we include stories, anecdotes, and interviews that involve only one of us. To make clear who is involved, we must, in effect, quote ourselves: &#x201c;As Tom recalled . . .&#x201d; &#x201c;As Michael wrote . . .&#x201d; You can&#x2019;t simply say &#x201c;I said&#x201d; or &#x201c;I saw&#x201d; when you have a co-authored book with a lot of reporting in it.<br>Readers familiar with our work know us mainly as authors and commentators, but we are also both, well, Americans. That is important, because that identity drives the book as much as our policy interests do. So here are just a few words of introduction from each of us&#x2014;not as experts but as citizens.Tom: I was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and was raised in a small suburb called St. Louis Park&#x2014;made famous by the brothers Ethan and Joel Coen in their movie A Serious Man, which was set in our neighbor- hood. Senator Al Franken, the Coen brothers, the Harvard political philosopher Michael J. Sandel, the political scientist Norman Ornstein, the longtime NFL football coach Marc Trestman, and I all grew up in and around that little suburb within a few years of one another, and it surely had a big impact on all of us. In my case, it bred a deep optimism about America and the notion that we really can act collectively for the common good.<br>In 1971, the year I graduated from high school, Time magazine had a cover featuring then Minnesota governor Wendell Anderson holding up a fish he had just caught, under the headline &#x201c;The Good Life in Minnesota.&#x201d; It was all about &#x201c;the state that works.&#x201d; When the senators from your childhood were the Democrats Hubert Humphrey, Walter Mondale, and Eugene McCarthy, your congressmen were the moderate Republicans Clark MacGregor and Bill Frenzel, and the leading corporations in your state&#x2014;Dayton&#x2019;s, Target, General Mills, and 3M&#x2014;were pioneers in corporate social responsibility and believed that it was part of their mission to help build things like the Tyrone Guthrie Theater, you wound up with a deep conviction that politics really can work and that there is a viable political center in American life.<br>I attended public school with the same group of kids from K through 12. In those days in Minnesota, private schools were for kids in trouble. Private school was pretty much unheard of for middle-class St. Louis Park kids, and pretty much everyone was middle-class. My mom en- listed in the U.S. Navy in World War II, and my parents actually bought our home thanks to the loan she got through the GI Bill. My dad, who never went to college, was vice president of a company that sold ball bearings. My wife, Ann Friedman, was born in Marshalltown, Iowa, and was raised in Des Moines. To this day, my best friends are still those kids I grew up with in St. Louis Park, and I still carry around a mental image&#x2014;no doubt idealized&#x2014;of Minnesota that anchors and informs a lot of my political choices. No matter where I go&#x2014;London, Beirut, Jerusalem, Washington, Beijing, or Bangalore&#x2014;I&#x2019;m always looking to rediscover that land of ten thousand lakes where politics actually worked to make people&#x2019;s lives better, not pull them apart. That used to be us. In fact, it used to be my neighborhood.&nbsp;Michael: While Tom and his wife come from the middle of the country, my wife, Anne Mandelbaum, and I grew up on the two coasts&#x2014;she in Manhattan and I in Berkeley, California. My father was a professor of anthropology at the University of California, and my mother, after my two siblings and I reached high school age, became a public school teacher and then joined the education faculty at the university that we called, simply, Cal.<br>Although Berkeley has a reputation for political radicalism, during my childhood in the 1950s it had more in common with Tom&#x2019;s Minneapolis than with the Berkeley the world has come to know. It was more a slice of Middle America than a hotbed of revolution. As amazing as it may seem today, for part of my boyhood it had a Republican mayor and was represented by a Republican congressman.<br>One episode from those years is particularly relevant to this book. It occurred in the wake of the Soviet Union&#x2019;s 1957 launching of Sputnik, the first Earth-orbiting satellite. The event was a shock to the United States, and the shock waves reached Garfield Junior High School (since renamed after Martin Luther King Jr.), where I was in seventh grade. The entire student body was summoned to an assembly at which the principal solemnly informed us that in the future we all would have to study harder, and that mathematics and science would be crucial.<br>Given my parents&#x2019; commitment to education, I did not need to be told that school and studying were important. But I was impressed by the gravity of the moment. I understood that the United States faced a national challenge and that everyone would have to contribute to meeting it. I did not doubt that America, and Americans, would meet it. There is no going back to the 1950s, and there are many reasons to be glad that that is so, but the kind of seriousness the country was capable of then is just as necessary now.<br>We now live and work in the nation&#x2019;s capital, where we have seen first- hand the government&#x2019;s failure to come to terms with the major challenges the country faces. But although this book&#x2019;s perspective on the present is gloomy, its hopes and expectations for the future are high. We know that America can meet its challenges. After all, that&#x2019;s the America where we grew up.<br>Thomas L. Friedman <br>Michael Mandelbaum <br>Bethesda, Maryland, June 2011&nbsp;THAT USED TO BE US � 2011 by Thomas Friedman and Michael Mandelbaum</p><h2>Elizabeth the Queen: The Life of a Modern Monarch</h2><p>A tribute to the life and enduring reign of Elizabeth II draws on numerous interviews and previously undisclosed documents to juxtapose the queen's public and private lives, providing coverage of such topics as her teen romance with Philip, her contributions during World War II and the scandals that have challenged her family. (biography &amp; autobiography).</p><p><strong>A Letter from Sally Bedell Smith</strong> <p></p> <p>As a five-year-old, I first glimpsed Queen Elizabeth II on the black and white screen in my parents&#x2019; mahogany television cabinet in 1953: a glamorous ingenue draped in gleaming robes and wearing a glittering crown during her coronation in Westminster Abbey. Two generations later, children watched her as a proud and bespectacled grandmother in the same majestic setting during the wedding of Prince William to Kate Middleton.</p> <p>For sixty years, the Queen has been a constant presence as the longest serving head of state--iconic, distant, mysterious, dutiful--the only person about whom it can truly be said that all the world is a stage.</p> <p>I first met her in 2007 at a garden party at the British ambassador&#x2019;s residence in Washington, D.C. In a spirited conversation with my husband about the Kentucky Derby, she showed the animated gestures, sparkling blue eyes and flashing smile familiar to her friends but rare in public. I remembered what British artist Howard Morgan had told me after painting her portrait: &#x201c;Her private side took me totally by surprise. She talks like an Italian! She waves her hands about.&#x201d; </p> <p>Nine months later I began my three year exploration of the Queen&#x2019;s epic life. I was determined to make her accessible, to bring readers into her world and show that private side in an intimate and humanizing way. I also wanted to explain how she has been so successful in her unique role, and how she became &#x201c;the sheet anchor in the middle for people to hang on to in times of turbulence,&#x201d; in the words of David Airlie, her lifelong friend and former senior adviser. </p> <p>As a woman I was intrigued by how she thrived in a man&#x2019;s world, juggling her roles as dedicated professional as well as wife and mother. I also wanted to describe for the first time her close relationship with the United States--her eleven visits, five of them private, and her friendships with an array of fascinating Americans including all the presidents since Harry Truman--except Lyndon Johnson, who desperately tried to meet her. </p> <p>There seemed to be a surprise around every corner: her physical courage when she was attacked by a wounded pheasant and charged by &#x201c;dive bombing colts,&#x201d; her compassion while mothering a teenaged cousin who had been nearly killed in a terrorist attack, her earthiness while crawling on her belly stalking deer, her joie de vivre while blowing bubbles at a friend&#x2019;s birthday party, her fierce reaction to one of her top advisers in the days after the death of Diana, her tenderness toward Margaret Thatcher during the former prime minister&#x2019;s 80th birthday party. </p><p>After two years of research and interviewing, it took another year to write the Queen&#x2019;s story--to weave together the threads of a life of richness and variety with a great cast of characters both famous and little-known. I hope the result will enable readers to immerse themselves in her life--from the grouse moors of Scotland and kitchen tables of her friends to the state banquets and time-honored pageantry, where even in the middle of the solemn ritual of her coronation, the Archbishop of Canterbury could sneak the 27-year-old Queen sips from a hidden flask of brandy for a pick-me-up. </p><b>Sally Bedell Smith</b> is the author of&nbsp; bestselling biographies of William S.

Nicknamed the &#x201c;Fort Knox of Uranium,&#x201d; Y-12 was supposedly one of the most secure sites in the world, a bastion of warhead parts and hundreds of tons of highly enriched uranium&#x2014;enough to power thousands of nuclear bombs. The three activists&#x2014;a house painter, a Vietnam War veteran, and an 82-year-old Catholic nun&#x2014;penetrated the complex&#x2019;s exterior with alarming ease; their strongest tools were two pairs of bolt cutters and three hammers. Once inside, these pacifists hung protest banners, spray-painted biblical messages, and streaked the walls with human blood. Then they waited to be arrested.<br><br> <b>WITH THE BREAK-IN</b> and their symbolic actions, the activists hoped to draw attention to a costly military-industrial complex that stockpiles deadly nukes. But they also triggered a political and legal firestorm of urgent and troubling questions. What if they had been terrorists? Why do the United States and Russia continue to possess enough nuclear weaponry to destroy the world several times over?<br><br> <b>IN <i>ALMIGHTY</i>, <i>WASHINGTON POST</i> REPORTER</b> Dan Zak answers these questions by reexamining America&#x2019;s love-hate relationship to the bomb, from the race to achieve atomic power before the Nazis did to the solemn 70th anniversary of Hiroshima. At a time of concern about proliferation in such nations as Iran and North Korea, the U.S. arsenal is plagued by its own security problems. This life-or-death quandary is unraveled in Zak&#x2019;s eye-opening account, with a cast that includes the biophysicist who first educated the public on atomic energy, the prophet who predicted the creation of Oak Ridge, the generations of activists propelled into resistance by their faith, and the Washington bureaucrats and diplomats who are trying to keep the world safe. Part historical adventure, part courtroom drama, part moral thriller, <i>Almighty</i> reshapes the accepted narratives surrounding nuclear weapons and shows that our greatest modern-day threat remains a power we discovered long ago.</p><p>Dan Zak is a reporter for <i>The Washington Post</i>.

This life-affirming correspondence concerns her internment at Westerbork, a transit camp that the Hillesum family and more than 100,000 other Dutch Jews passed through en route to Auschwitz. Hillesum keenly details the diversity of the inmates, the camp's squalor, the hellish transports and the incomprehensibility of their situation: "The sky is full of birds, the purple lupins stand up so regally and peacefully, two little old women have sat down for a chat, the sun is shining on my face, and right before our eyes, mass murder." Readers won't fail to marvel at her fortitude, her refusal to bow to hatred or despair and her capacity for selfless humaneness: "Against every new outrage and every fresh horror, we shall put up one more piece of love and goodness," and, written on a postcard she threw from the train that took her to Auschwitz, "We left the camp singing."

The missionary call is a vital part of the life of every follower of Jesus Christ and, therefore, the church. But the effective discipleship of all nations requires a solid biblical, historical, and practical foundation. Therefore, the study of missiology demands the effective application of biblical studies, theology, and history. <br><br>This text brings the rich heritage of evangelical missiology founded on conservative theology to a twenty-first century audience passionate for the proclamation of the gospel. Introduction to Global Missions brings the authors&#x2019; decades of combined missionary and teaching experience to a survey text appropriate for college or seminary classroom. <br><br>The book is divided into four sections and thirteen chapters. The text begins with the biblical and theological foundations of Christian missions, including a biblical theology of missions. Before moving to the practical and strategic issues of twenty-first century missions, the authors consider the historical development of missions with a view toward providing a basis for contemporary strategies. A final foundational set of chapters addresses the impact of cultures on the communication of the gospel. The remainder of the text deals with key issues and opportunities in missions, including church planting, missions in the local church, and strategies for disciple-making. <br><br><i>Introduction to Global Missions</i> provides a foundation for readers to consider their own missionary call, whether as a full-time field missionary or a church member on short-term projects.

From Freud to <em>Babbitt,</em> from Relativity to Susan Sontag, from Proust to Henri Bergson to Saul Bellow, the books range is encyclopedic, covering the major writers, artists, scientists, and philosophers who produced the ideas by which we live. Beginning with four seminal ideas that were introduced in 1900 -- the unconscious, the gene, the quantum, and Picasso's first paintings in Paris-Peter Watson has produced a fluent and engaging narrative of the intellectual tradition of the past century.</p><p>The book is divided into four parts -- Freud to Wittgenstein; Spengler to <em>Animal Farm;</em> Sartre to the Sea of Tranquillity; the counterculture to Kosovo -- and there are forty-two chapters. Watson emphasizes that "the century may be understood as a period during which the scientific method colonized all modes of thought and changed the way thinking is done." He sees the first half of the century as a period of discovery and the last half as a period of analysis, synthesis, and understanding, and he explores the role of the United States in setting the century's agenda in many areas. Unlike more conventional histories, in which the focus is on political events and personalities, <em>The Modern Mind</em> is an illuminating blueprint of twentieth-century thought and culture and the men and women who created it.</p></p><p><p>Peter Watson has been a senioreditor at the London <em>Sunday Times</em>, a New York correspondentof the <em>London Times</em>, a columnist for theLondon <em>Observer</em>, and a contributor to the <em>New YorkTimes</em>. He has published three expos�s on the world ofart and antiquities, and is the author of several booksof cultural and intellectual history. From 1997 to 2007he was a research associate at the McDonald Institutefor Archaeological Research at the University of Cambridge.He lives in London.</p>Just as the 20th century dawned with an unparalleled optimism regarding the moral, social and scientific progress of humanity, it ended with an unshakeable confidence in the promises of technology and the power of free-market economics to deliver a better life for all humankind. British journalist Watson's (War on the Mind; The Caravaggio Conspiracy; etc.) panoramic survey traces various 20th-century ideas and their power to bend and shape society and individuals. At a frenetic pace, he gallops through the modern intellectual landscape, pausing long enough to graze the founts of philosophy (from Wittgenstein to Richard Rorty to Alasdair MacIntyre), literature (Kafka, Woolf, Mann, Rushdie), literary criticism (F.R. Leavis to Jacques Derrida), art (Picasso to Warhol), economics (Milton Friedman to John Kenneth Galbraith), science (Linus Pauling to E.O. Wilson) and film (D.W. Griffiths to Fran?ois Truffaut). He also briefly examines the significance of a wide range of political and cultural movements, such as socialism, communism, fascism, feminism and environmentalism. Watson's rich narrative covers every corner of intellectual life in the 20th century, yet the style is so breezy and anecdotal that it lacks the deep learned elegance of a history of ideas by, for example, Isaiah Berlin or Jacques Barzun. Unfortunately, for all the book's breadth, Watson's workmanlike approach has the feel of a handful of school assignments cobbled together from encyclopedia articles rather than of work drawn from years of thoughtful reflection and an intimate acquaintance with, and love of, ideas. <br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Steck-Vaughn Phonics, Book B</h2><p>Colorful workbook style pages to be completed.</p><p></p><h2>Paint Along with Jerry Yarnell Volume Three - Painting Magic</h2><p><p><b>Love to paint?

Shipping is from AK so it takes some time to get to the lower 48.</p><p>Volume two of the Cerebus the Aardvark series, <i>High Society</i>, is the beginning of the main Cerebus story line and one of the finest graphic novels ever published. If you have to start from the very beginning, you'll need the first volume, <i>Cerebus</i>, but if you don't mind a modicum of confusion, this is a much more satisfying place to begin. The artwork is much improved and the level of humor reaches its high point in the series to date. (Unkind critics point to <i>High Society</i> as the older, funnier book of the Cerebus series.)<p> Parliamentary politics were never so much fun as they are in the Prime Minister election of 1414. Lord Julius and the mysterious Astoria battle for control of the city-state Iest with Cerebus as their unwitting pawn. Goats, bunny sketches, the Regency Elf, and Moon Roach join the pandemonium, helping to set the stage for things to come. <i>High Society</i> is a home run; an instant classic both as a stand-alone volume and in the context of the rest of the series. Beware though, the ending dovetails directly into <i>Church and State</i>; You may want to grab that volume as well, because once you start the series, the story of Cerebus gets increasingly harder to put down.</p></p><h2>The Best of Barbara Johnson</h2><p>Barbara Johnson's whimsical and uplifting sense of humor is the unforgettable hallmark of these three bestsellers, <em>Stick a Geranium in Your Hat and Be Happy!, Splashes of Joy in the Cesspools of Life, </em>and <em>Pick Up Your Gloomees in a Great Big Box, then Sit on the Lid and Laugh!</em>&nbsp; These encouraging works are filled with bittersweet stories of tragedy and triumph.&nbsp; Each short, easy-to-read chapter is packed with cheerful anecdotes, funny quotes, and biblical advice.</p><p><b>Barbara Johnson</b> guided millions of hurting women through the tunnel of despair with her best-selling books including <i>Plant a Geranium in Your Cranium, Living Somewhere Between Estrogen and Death, </i>and <i>Stick a Geranium in Your Hat and Be Happy.</i> She and her husband, Bill, founded the non-profit Spatula Ministries which helps parents in crisis.

Some of her poetry has been noted in recent years for strong feminist themes, but the poems for which Elizabeth Barrett Browning is undoubtedly best know are <i>Sonnets from the Portuguese.</i></p><p>Written for Robert Browning, who had affectionately nicknamed her his "little Portuguese," the sequence is a celebration of marriage, and of one of the most famous romances of the nineteenth century. Recognized for their Victorian tradition and discipline, these are some of the most passionate and memorable love poems in the English language. There are forty-four poems in the collection, including the very beautiful sonnet, "How do I love thee? Let me count the ways."</p></p><p>First published in 1850 and considered some of the finest love lyrics in the English language, <i>Sonnets From The Portuguese</i> comprise 44 interlocking poems that Elizabeth Barrett Browning composed for her husband, Robert Browning. This wonderful illustrated edition includes 22 additional works as well.<p></p><p>B &amp; W illustrations throughout</p>First published in 1850 and considered some of the finest love lyrics in the English language, <i>Sonnets from the Portuguese</i> comprise 44 interlocking poems that Elizabeth Barrett Browning composed for her husband, Robert Browning. This wonderful illustrated edition includes 22 additional works as well.</p><h2>Collected Stories of Wallace Stegner</h2><p>Presents a selection of stories that includes &#34;He Who Spits at the Sky,&#34; &#34;The Women of the Wall,&#34; &#34;Pop Goes the Alley Cat,&#34; &#34;The View from the Balcony,&#34; and &#34;The Wolfer&#34;</p><p>These 31 classic stories record much of the cultural climate of 20th-century America, its West in particular, constituting, as the NBA and Pulitzer Prize-winning author affectionately notes, not an autobiography, but "a sort of personal record." As combined here, the tales are a window onto a vivid American past that is as focused as a Norman Rockwell painting, although far more astringent and hardly as wholesome. Settings range from Stegner's native Canada to Utah, California and Vermont--all memorable places in the author's life. The stories are not arranged chronologically: Stegner's dark, voyeuristic peek into the lives of women awaiting letters from men serving in WW II gives way to an account of a bloodthirsty boyhood on the hot, flat frontier of a Saskatchewan farm. Best of all is the slicing wit of "Field Guide to the Western Birds," in which a curmudgeon acidly comments on the petulant antics of a would-be virtuoso. Several of the stories have been reshaped and interpolated into such novels as Wolf Willow and The Big Rock Candy Mountain. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.Stegner is best known for his epic novels of the American West--books such as the Pulitzer Prize-winning Angle of Repose (1971)--but in his younger years he was a prolific short story writer. Like the novels, Stegner's stories are traditional in style and typically look back with nostalgic longing to a nobler period of America's past. However, since most of these works were written in the Thirties, Forties, and Fifties, the "present" Stegner condemns is itself impossibly old-fashioned, and his anti-modern bias seems a bit ridiculous. Some of the stories in this collection are simply museum pieces, but several retain their vitality, notably "The Sweetness of the Twisted Apples," "The City of the Living," and "The Volunteer."

Dworkin ( Letters from a War Zone ), who lobbies for municipal statutes declaring pornography a violation of women's civil rights, insists that pornography links sex and violence by incorporating violent domination of women as a key element of sexual fantasy: "Force in high-class pornography is romanticized . . . as if it were dance." Dworkin also takes what many consider to be an extreme position; she believes that pornography incites men to sexual violence. To support her thesis, she draws parallels between the life and writings of the Marquis de Sade and provides critical summaries of several contemporary pornographic works. Dworkin's style is intense, vivid and eloquent, infused with a sense of urgency. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Kitchen Linens Book: Using, Sharing, and Cherishing the Fabrics of Our Daily Lives</h2><p>Gather 'round!

Jackson must clear himself of a murder accusation in this seventeenth Martha's Vineyard mystery. J. W. has an altercation at the fish market with rabid environmentalist Henry Highsmith, who seems spoiling for a fight; then, when J. W.'s golf foursome finds Highsmith's body buried in a sand trap, J. W. finds himself a suspect. The fact that Henry's wife, Abigail, is run off the road on her bicycle by an SUV that looks like J. W.'s only adds fuel to the fire. The former cop turned housesitter, fisherman, and performer of odd jobs investigates while taking care of his young children in this family-centered mystery. (J. W. is likely to take his kids along to question suspects when he isn't building them a rope bridge in the backyard.) A wonderfully evoked sense of place and a sensitive exploration of environmental issues combine with likable characters and plenty of humor in this long-running and always entertaining series. The resolution of the mystery is not much of a surprise this time, but series fans will find their pleasure elsewhere. <i>Sue O'Brien</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

In <em>Lee Krasner</em>, author Gail Levin gives us an engrossing biography of the painter&#x2014;so memorably portrayed in the movie <em>Pollack</em> by actor Marcia Gay Harden, who won an Academy Award for her performance&#x2014;a firebrand and trailblazer for women&#x2019;s rights as well as an exceptional artist who led a truly fascinating life.<br></p><p><p>Lee Krasner is best known as the artist-wife of Jackson Pollock, the renowned abstract expressionist painter. Yet in this riveting new biography, the first full-length account of her colorful life, distinguished art historian Gail Levin challenges previous portrayals of Krasner, and shows that she was an independent and resourceful woman of uncompromising talent and prodigious energy. Krasner emerges as a significant artist who deserves her place in the twentieth century's cultural lexicon and artistic pantheon.</p><p>The daughter of Jewish immigrants newly arrived from Russia, Krasner grew up impoverished in Brooklyn. With no support or role model, she began to make her own way during the late 1920s and early 1930s as a talented, outspoken artist and political progressive. Krasner's contemporaries, who took notice of her remarkable sex appeal, drive, and ambition, were either captivated or threatened, but they all found her memorable. During the Great Depression, she supported herself painting murals for the WPA, was called a Trotskyite for speaking out at the Artists Union, and got arrested for demonstrating on behalf of workers' rights. </p><p>In 1936 Krasner first encountered an intoxicated Jackson Pollock at an Artists Union dance. They met again by chance when both were about to be featured in the same group show in 1942, and soon they were a couple, marrying three years later. To nurture Pollock and his talent, Krasner gave up her life in the city, where she had socialized easily with fellow artists such as Arshile Gorky, Willem de Kooning, and Piet Mondrian. Once they moved to Long Island's rural East End, Krasner and Pollock became the center of a new avant-garde community. In this captivating book, Gail Levin probes Krasner's relationship with Pollock, examining how this strong woman struggled to meet the challenges of their poverty, as well as her husband's alcoholism and extramarital affairs, all the while encouraging his art. Levin uncovers never-before-told stories of how Krasner managed so skillfully to market Pollock's work and how this eventually raised prices for all the abstract expressionists.</p><p>Drawing on new sources and numerous personal interviews&#x2014;including with Krasner, whom Levin knew and interviewed during the last years of the artist's life&#x2014;Levin has written a dynamic, compelling, and moving portrait of a brilliant woman that recovers Krasner's voice and allows us to see that her life intersected with and informed her art.</p><p>Gail Levin is the author of <em>Edward Hopper: An Intimate Biography</em>, <em>Becoming Judy Chicago</em>, and many other books on twentieth-century and contemporary art. She is Distinguished Professor of Art History, American Studies, and Women's Studies at the Graduate Center and Baruch College of the City University of New York. </p></p><h2>Fly Away Peter</h2><p>In this shimmering work of imagination, one of Australia's most honored writers conjures a single still moment on the edge of the 20th century in which two unlikely people share a friendship. When Ashley Crowther returns to Australia to manage his father's property, he discovers a timeless landscape of kingfishers and ibises; he also meets Jim Saddler, the young woodsman who becomes Ashley's guide to his inheritance. Together they discard the differences of personality and class to enter a partnership of wonder. But when war breaks out in Europe, Jim and Ashley are drawn into obscene enterprise of the trenches, where death falls from the sky and burrows out of the earth. In telling the story of these men, <b>Fly Away Peter</b> combines overwhelmingly sensual imagery with an unblinking consciousness of the worst that history can inflict to produce a novel of phosphorescent beauty.</p><p>David Malouf<i> </i>is the author of ten novels and six volumes of poetry.

Beginning with the reign of Hadrian in Rome and ending with the death of Julian the Apostate on campaign in Persia, it offers an intimate account of the twists and often deadly turns of imperial politics in which successive emperors rose and fell with sometimes bewildering rapidity. Yet, despite this volatility, the Romans were able to see off successive attacks by Parthians, Germans, Persians and Goths and to extend and entrench their position as masters of Europe and the Mediterranean. This books shows how they managed to do it.</p><p>Professor Michael Kulikowski describes the empire's cultural integration in the second century, the political crises of the third when Rome's Mediterranean world became subject to the larger forces of Eurasian history, and the remaking of Roman imperial institutions in the fourth century under Constantine and his son Constantius II. The Constantinian revolution, Professor Kulikowski argues, was the pivot on which imperial fortunes turned - and the beginning of the parting of ways between the eastern and western empires.</p><p>This sweeping account of one of the world's greatest empires at its magnificent peak is incisive, authoritative and utterly gripping.</p></p><p></p><h2>Sea of Grey: An Alan Lewrie Naval Adventure (Alan Lewrie Naval Adventures, 10)</h2><p><p><b>Captain Alan Lewrie returns in Dewey Lambdin's tenth roaring adventure on the high seas. </b></p><p>This time, it's off to a failing British intervention on the ultra-rich French colony of Saint Domingue, wracked by an utterly cruel and bloodthirsty slave rebellion led by Toussaint L'Ouverture, the future father of Haitian independence.

But he <i>was</i> paying, so &#x2026; Given Sir Hugo&#x2019;s &#x201c;sportin&#x2019;&#x201d; nature, it was no wonder that they had ended the evening at The Cocoa Tree, one of the fastest gambling establishments in London. Ostensibly a proprietary coffee-house where men of the Tory persuasion were wont to gather, it set a magnificent table, and was all &#x201c;the go&#x201d; with those wealthy enough (or foolish enough!) to riffle the cards in the Long Rooms or lay side wagers, even to take an &#x201c;insurance policy&#x201d; on someone <i>else &#x2019;s</i> life; i.e., to wager just when a certain cove would croak! <i>Least it ain&#x2019;t a &#x201c;cock and hen&#x201d; club</i>, Lewrie thought, most pleasantly stuffed and &#x201c;whiffled&#x201d; by then; <i>I&#x2019;m in enough trouble.</i> For a time, it had seemed as if one of those shadier establishments <i>might</i> feature in the afternoon and night&#x2019;s activities, as he and his father had made the rounds. First had come a gentlemanly tavern, near Sir Hugo&#x2019;s old haunts in St. James&#x2019;s Square for a few badly needed stiff ones, followed by a saunter east to the theatre district for a lively farce, which was followed by a patriotic display in honour of Admiral Duncan and the Battle of Camperdown&#x2014;with offers of gallons of free drink from fellow theatre patrons near their box, and Sir Hugo gallantly stroking the mustachios he did not have (reducing the slaver, Lewrie thought it) as he boldly gazed down the bodices of the promising young ladies, or leered at the eager young orange-sellers. Followed by a traipse through Covent Garden&#x2019;s vast and crowded arcade, where anything or anyone could be had at a decent price if one but haggled a bit, where smuggled French champagne had been prominently featured (Lewrie was <i>pretty</i> sure); thence here, to The Cocoa Tree, and a lashing or two more of wine accompanying supper, along with the odd &#x201c;revivor&#x201d; brandy, now the port. Squinting only just a tad to maintain focus, Lewrie studied the many ladies present, strolling and flouncing past the communal table at which he and his father had shared supper with a pack of strangers. A lively pack of roisterers, in the main, but new to both of them. The Cocoa Tree maintained a certain air of proper decorum, just as the resort at Bath did. Only true ladies welcome in Society, with a requisite purseful of &#x201c;chink,&#x201d; and the itch to risk it, were allowed. Quite unlike his dissolute youth, in the pre-Navy days, when he and his usual mob of bucks-of-the-first-head had frequented places like The Spread Eagle in the Strand, The Highflyer at the Old Turf Coffee-House, or The Free And Easy, where after the theatre (or long before!) the fast, the poor, and the criminal could commingle, drink, and chorus with the prettier doxies of whatever class or station, and arrange what sport they wished upstairs, at a nearby <i>bagnio</i> or by-the-hour rooming house. Oh, how he&#x2019;d crowed back then, all cock-a-whoop in harmony with the &#x201c;hens!&#x201d; <i>Spending money like a drunken &#x2026; sailor</i>, which he squiffily realised he was, both in the nautical and the &#x201c;drunken&#x201d; sense. &#x201c; &#x2026; just a bloody nuisance&#x201d; his father Sir Hugo was saying in aspersion as he wiped his mouth with a napkin as his plate of pudding was whisked away by a table-servant. &#x201c;Women should not gamble anymore than they should attempt to smoke, or curse.&#x201d; To which their companions at-table grunted their amiable and dismissive agreements. &#x201c;Had I the &#x2018;tin,&#x2019; I&#x2019;d found a man-only club, gentlemen. <i>Somewhat</i> like The Cocoa Tree, White&#x2019;s, Almack&#x2019;s, or Boodle&#x2019;s &#x2026; with the ladies allowed in to <i>dine</i> and be decorative, surely, but shoo them out by midnight. Make a male sanctuary, before they overrun all our masculine institutions by the battalions. Dash it all, a place where men may rest &#x2019;twixt entertainments, perhaps with lodgings, where a feller may let down his hair and put up his feet &#x2026; .&#x201d; &#x201c;Hear, hear!&#x201d; one of their fellow diners cheered. &#x201c;Gentlemen of standing and quality only allowed,&#x201d; he posed, drawing agreement from several others who had been seated by twos or singletons at their long table, hit-or-miss. &#x201c;An in-town retreat for serving officers, say,&#x201d; another opined. &#x201c;Reasonably priced, of course, so we won&#x2019;t have to hunt high and low for lodgings each time we come up to London. Like a regimental mess, a ward-room, or &#x2026;&#x201d; the gentleman in Army uniform, a captain of foot, proposed. He was well turned out, but half his worth was surely on his back, Lewrie thought, not in his purse or with his banker. &#x201c;What say you, Captain Lewrie?&#x201d; the Army man asked him. &#x201c;An intriguing idea?&#x201d; &#x201c;Most,&#x201d; Lewrie answered, which was about all he could manage as a belch arose, redolent of baked sole, roast beef, pigeon pie, and wine. &#x201c;A refuge from &#x2026; domesticity,&#x201d; he glumly supposed. To which sentiment, all eight men present voiced an earnest &#x201c;Ever and amen&#x201d; with a hearty, rumbling cheer, though his father peered over at him with a chary, cutty-eyed look of pending disapproval. Sir Hugo had warned him that, should he turn maudlin and weepy, he&#x2019;d deny knowing him, and leave him to stew in his own misery! &#x201c;Quite intriguin&#x2019;, Captain Browne,&#x201d; Sir Hugo mused, louder than necessary, perhaps to draw attention from his son to himself, after a stern, silent warning, which came off, as most of Sir Hugo&#x2019;s facial expressions, as a nettled falcon&#x2019;s leer, before prosing on. &#x201c;The best part of a coffee-house in the mornings, with rafts of daily papers. Good conversation, good wine cellar &#x2026; with decent sets of rooms to let for members-only when down from the country, Members of Parliament, for serving officers, as you suggest, Captain Browne &#x2026; an establishment that offers only the freshest victuals, so that no one dies for tryin&#x2019; the fare at a two-penny ordinary, haw!&#x201d; &#x201c;Exactly, General Willoughby,&#x201d; another of their fellow diners opined in a plumby voice, &#x201c;with annual dues and daily charges just high enough to dissuade the lower orders, but within the reach of purses of most gentlemen. With requirements, mark you, sirs, for good character and decorous gentlemanly behaviour.&#x201d; The very idea of a reference from one&#x2019;s vicar as part of one&#x2019;s <i>bona fides</i> set them back in a stunned silence for a moment. The fellow <i>was</i> sober-dressed, spare and gaunt-lookin&#x2019;; was he a Dissenter, one of those Kill-Joys? <i>Well</i>, <i>that&#x2019;d let me out, and Father</i>, <i>too</i>, Lewrie told himself. &#x201c;Within the club, of course, sirs,&#x201d; the fellow amended quickly, seeing the response he&#x2019;d drawn. &#x201c;Mean t&#x2019;say, run riot on your own &#x2026; but damme if I&#x2019;ll tolerate hoo-rawin&#x2019; drunks who drop their shoes and giggle, past my bedtime. Schoolboy antics, sons down from university with all their silly carryings-on!&#x201d; Well, that was alright, then! One of their fellow diners looked ready to call for quill, ink, and paper to begin setting down the bylaws, <i>instanter!</i> Grandly liveried waiters set out fresh glasses, dishes of grapes and berries, plates of sliced cheeses with both sweet and salted biscuits before them, along with baskets of assorted nuts, with shell bowls and nutcrackers. Sir Hugo sternly proposed a toast to the King; safe to do, with the water glasses removed, so toasting Hanoverian George III could not be rendered into one for the exiled Stuart claimant, the &#x201c;king over the water,&#x201d; by a sly pass of one&#x2019;s port glass! &#x201c;Gentlemen, allow me to propose our second,&#x201d; Captain Browne said as he got to his feet. &#x201c;In honour of our dining companion who fought at Camperdown, and won us the marvellous victory all England celebrates tonight &#x2026; to the Royal Navy, and Camperdown!&#x201d; &#x201c;Navy &#x2026; and Camperdown!&#x201d; they concisely echoed, on their feet. Lewrie, too, rose, though a naval officer never stood to toast the King if he valued his scalp. Low deck beams made their own tradition. Which sentiment was quickly followed by a toast to Admiral Duncan, now made Baron Duncan of Lundie and Viscount Duncan of Camperdown; then followed by a toast to Lewrie himself, as a representative of the fleet that had won the victory, through which he modestly sat, forming turns of phrase in his head for the expected gallant response. &#x201c;Gentlemen, my thanks to you for the honour, though I must confess that my part in the battle was not <i>that</i> significant,&#x201d; he answered in kind, though the gold Camperdown Medal bestowed upon him by the King that afternoon tinkled against the matching Battle of Cape St. Vincent Medal. &#x201c;Pshaw!&#x201d; Sir Hugo objected. &#x201c;You took one of their frigates!&#x201d; Their boisterous toasting and cheering had drawn enough notice from the elegant crowd in the dining rooms, but his father said it loud enough to turn it into an attention-getting boast on the &#x201c;spawn of his loins.&#x201d; &#x201c;Allow me to answer with a three-fold proposal,&#x201d; Alan said as he got to his feet a trifle unsteadily, making a supportive triangle from the fingers of his right hand for a moment, before taking up a refilled glass of port to hold before him and peer into its semi-opaque redness as if for inspiration. &#x201c;First, for my ship, the <i>Proteus</i> frigate, the finest, soundest Fifth Rate that ever swam. Secondly, to her crew, the bravest tars ever plied rammer, rope, or cutlass. From highest to lowest, <i>they</i> produced victory, ev&#x2019;ry man jack! And lastly to our recent foes, the Dutch. They fought us English-fashion, hull-to-hull, yardarm-to-yardarm, and held stout to the last, past the time when their hopes were gone. Gentlemen, I give you HMS <i>Proteus</i>, her crew, and a worthy foe!&#x201d; &#x201c; <i>Proteus</i> &#x2026; tars/sailors/yer crew &#x2026; the Dutch/foes!&#x201d; others babbled, mangling his toast. Lewrie feared it would be too much for them, but to Blazes with that, he thought; they were lusty and loud, and that was what counted&#x2014;loud enough to raise &#x201c;Huzzahs!&#x201d; from the onlookers, too, who&#x2019;d been drawn by the noise at their table. &#x201c;Tryin&#x2019; t&#x2019;prove yer sobriety?&#x201d; his father teasingly said as he seated himself again. &#x201c;Showin&#x2019; how you can still form compound sentences this late?&#x201d; &#x201c;Wanted it out and done, before I went under the table,&#x201d; Lewrie told him. &#x201c;Else we&#x2019;d all be half-seas-over before we got round to the toasts to the ladies!&#x201d; Quite a few of the onlookers were fashionably dressed ladies in company of male companions, or two women out together despite the rigid rules of London Society; dashing, unconventional morts who ogled him as openly as he&#x2019;d ogle them, given the chance, A mixture of hero worship, sympathy for his nobly-wounded &#x201c;wing,&#x201d; that broken left arm still hung in a neat sling&#x2014;one or two licking their lips and half-lidding eyes. &#x201c;Here, Captain Lewrie,&#x201d; the elegantly dressed man, Mr. Lumsden, whom they&#x2019;d discovered was a City banker, demanded. &#x201c;The papers don&#x2019;t tell us half of how &#x2019;twas done. Do give us your account of it. Tell us the whole tale!&#x201d; &#x201c;Aye, and leave nought out!&#x201d; another pressed. &#x201c;Well &#x2026;&#x201d; Lewrie said, unwillingly forced to his feet again by their enthusiasm and the chance to preen for an audience. &#x201c;I will need the biscuits, nuts, and such, if you really insist.&#x201d; A row of salted biscuits quickly formed the Dutch coast, while walnuts became ships of the line, and smaller hickories became frigates and sloops of war. Lewrie looked at his creation, trying to picture a bird&#x2019;s view from the confused, smoke and haze-riddled scene he&#x2019;d had from his quarterdeck, wondering where or how to start to explain it at all. How does one re-organise chaos? &#x201c;When we sighted them, the wind was out of the Nor&#x2019;Nor&#x2019;west and fairly strong,&#x201d; he said, arrowing a hand, slant-wise, at the long line of Dutch ships. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m told they had been sailing Easterly, making for Calais and the Channel, but came about when our scouting frigates got hull-up on &#x2019;em.&#x201d; &#x201c;Running,&#x201d; the abstemious gentleman pronounced. &#x201c;Or luring us into shoal water, where their shallow-draught ships could fight, sir,&#x201d; Lewrie corrected him. &#x201c;The coast was only five miles or so to loo&#x2019;rd, and it shoals quickly, like tilting this table just a bit &#x2026; at low tide, a man could wade out half a mile, and be only up to his chest by then. Last cast of the log showed ten fathom &#x2026; only sixty feet of water.&#x201d; &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll need a translator, for all the nautical jargon!&#x201d; one of the diners hooted. &#x201c;The Dutch had sixteen ships of the line &#x2026; well, lighter than ours, really, and not all of &#x2018;em built as warships. Converted Dutch East Indiamen trapped in home ports,&#x201d; Lewrie went on. &#x201c;Admiral Duncan had eight ships in his division, with his flagship, <i>Venerable,</i> in the very lead. Here,&#x201d; he said, pointing to the easternmost gaggle. &#x201c;And Vice-Admiral Onslow&#x2019;s division, with <i>Monarch</i> in the lead, were quite a bit West of Duncan&#x2019;s, strung out all higgledy-piggledly, d&#x2019;ye see, in no proper order, since some of the older ships were poor sailers, even off the wind. &#x2019;Round eleven of the morning, Admiral Duncan even had to haul up to windward and beat back towards Onslow&#x2019;s group, so we could go in as a fleet, not a complete shambles.&#x201d; <i>Venerable, Ardent</i>, and <i>Triumph</i> had led, two 3rd Rate 74s, with a two-decker 64; a following wedge was made up of a lone 74-gunner, <i>Bedford,</i> flanked by a pair of 64s, <i>Lancaster</i>, and Capt. William &#x201c;Breadfruit&#x201d; Bligh&#x2019;s HMS <i>Director</i>. A third trio in loose order was even further astern; <i>Belliqueiux,</i> a 64-gunner, supported by two old two-deck 50-gun 4th Rate ships, <i>Adamant</i> and <i>Isis.</i> Vice-Admiral Onslow&#x2019;s group to the West had his flagship <i>Monarch</i> in the lead, with <i>Powerful</i> and <i>Monmouth</i> echeloned off to her right and stern, another pair of 74s with a 64; aft of them sailed a brace of 3rd Rate 74s, <i>Russel</i> and <i>Montagu;</i> trailing them was another pair, the 64-gunned <i>Veteran</i> and the 40-gun frigate <i>Beaulieu.</i> Well, there should have been a third 64-gun 3rd Rate with them, HMS <i>Agincourt,</i> but she was far astern, and <i>damn</i> her Capt. Williamson for hanging back the entire three hours of the battle! &#x201c;Not the strongest fleet, gentlemen,&#x201d; Lewrie said, after naming them. &#x201c;The rest, we frigates and gunboats, were in the centre. <i>Rose</i>, <i>Active</i>, and <i>Martin</i> were line-ahead together &#x2026; a pair of twelve-gunned sloops, with a sixteen-gunner. Near their larboard side were <i>Diligent</i> and <i>King George,</i> hired cutters with six and twelve guns. <i>Speculator</i>, astern of them, was a hired lugger with only eight guns! The <i>Circe</i> frigate was here, East of the sloops and cutters, and my own ship was here &#x2026; a bit East of <i>Circe</i>, and nigh level with Captain Bligh&#x2019;s ship, <i>Director</i> &#x2026; well, perhaps a tad ahead of her, nearer the <i>Bedford</i>,&#x201d; he said, shifting a hickory nut forward a half-inch. &#x201c;We were about four miles to windward of &#x2019;em when Duncan gave a signal to bear down and engage &#x2019;em. We repeated the signal, then bore off Easterly, with a touch of Southing, to pin the Dutch against their own coast, as it trends Northerly &#x2026; .&#x201d; &#x201c;Translator!&#x201d; an idle stroller who had come to observe over the others&#x2019; shoulders cried. &#x201c;This way.&#x201d; Lewrie grinned, employing a nutcracker for use as a wind-pointer. &#x201c;With the wind large on ...</p><h2>Human Sexual Response</h2><p>Very slight signs of age or use.

Then, in an absurd, magical twist of fate you find yourself surrounded by wizards, a caged snowy owl, a phoenix-feather wand, and jellybeans that come in every flavor, including strawberry, curry, grass, and sardine. Not only that, but you discover that you are a wizard yourself! This is exactly what happens to young Harry Potter in J.K. Rowling's enchanting, funny debut novel, <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</i>. In the nonmagic human world--the world of "Muggles"--Harry is a nobody, treated like dirt by the aunt and uncle who begrudgingly inherited him when his parents were killed by the evil Voldemort. But in the world of wizards, small, skinny Harry is famous as a survivor of the wizard who tried to kill him. He is left only with a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead, curiously refined sensibilities, and a host of mysterious powers to remind him that he's quite, yes, altogether different from his aunt, uncle, and spoiled, piglike cousin Dudley. <p> A mysterious letter, delivered by the friendly giant Hagrid, wrenches Harry from his dreary, Muggle-ridden existence: "We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry." Of course, Uncle Vernon yells most unpleasantly, "I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!" Soon enough, however, Harry finds himself at Hogwarts with his owl Hedwig... and that's where the real adventure--humorous, haunting, and suspenseful--begins. <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</i>, first published in England as <i>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</i>, continues to win major awards in England. So far it has won the National Book Award, the Smarties Prize, the Children's Book Award, and is short-listed for the Carnegie Medal, the U.K. version of the Newbery Medal. This magical, gripping, brilliant book--a future classic to be sure--will leave kids clamoring for <i>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</i> and <i>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</i>. (Ages 8 to 13) <i>--Karin Snelson</i></p>The beloved first book of the Harry Potter series, now fully illustrated by award-winning artist Jim Kay. For the first time, J. K. Rowling&#39;s beloved Harry Potter books will be presented in lavishly illustrated full-color editions. Rowling herself selected artist Jim Kay, whose over 100 illustrations make this deluxe format as perfect a gift for the child being introduced to the series as for the dedicated fan. Harry Potter has never been the star of a Quidditch team, scoring points while riding a broom far above the ground. He knows no spells, has never helped to hatch a dragon, and has never worn a cloak of invisibility. All he knows is a miserable life with the Dursleys, his horrible aunt and uncle, and their abominable son, Dudley - a great big swollen spoiled bully. Harry&#39;s room is a tiny closet at the foot of the stairs, and he hasn&#39;t had a birthday party in eleven years. But all that is about to change when a mysterious letter arrives by owl messenger: a letter with an invitation to an incredible place that Harry - and anyone who reads about him - will find unforgettable.</p><h2>Pandora&#x2019;s Box: A History of the First World War</h2><p><p><b>&#x201c;A major contribution...the best large-scale synthesis in any language of what we currently know and understand about this multidimensional, cataclysmic conflict.&#x201d;&#x2015;Richard J. Evans, <i>Times Literary Supplement</i></b></p><p>In this monumental history of the First World War, Germany&#x2019;s leading historian of the twentieth century&#x2019;s first great catastrophe explains the war&#x2019;s origins, course, and consequences. With an unrivaled combination of depth and global reach, <i>Pandora&#x2019;s Box</i> reveals how profoundly the war shaped the world to come.</p><p>J�rn Leonhard treats the clash of arms with a sure feel for grand strategy, the everyday tactics of dynamic movement and slow attrition, the race for ever more destructive technologies, and the grim experiences of frontline soldiers. But the war was much more than a military conflict, or an exclusively European one. Leonhard renders the perspectives of leaders, intellectuals, artists, and ordinary men and women on diverse home fronts as they grappled with the urgency of the moment and the rise of unprecedented political and social pressures. And he shows how the entire world came out of the war utterly changed.</p><p>Postwar treaties and economic turbulence transformed geopolitics. Old empires disappeared or confronted harsh new constraints, while emerging countries struggled to find their place in an age of instability. At the same time, sparked and fueled by the shock and suffering of war, radical ideologies in Europe and around the globe swept away orders that had seemed permanent, to establish new relationships among elites, masses, and the state. Heralded on its publication in Germany as a masterpiece of historical narrative and analysis, <i>Pandora&#x2019;s Box</i> makes clear just what dangers were released when the guns first fired in the summer of 1914.</p></p><p><p>J�rn Leonhard is Professor of European History at the University of Freiburg.</p>&#x201c;[A] monumental history...<i>Pandora&#x2019;s Box</i> is a major contribution to the historiography of the war, the best large-scale synthesis in any language of what we currently know and understand about this multidimensional, cataclysmic conflict...Leonhard has a rare gift for critical, intelligent narrative...A detailed, judicious and virtually comprehensive account of the war, its origins, its history and its consequences.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Richard J.

From the microcosm of the trenches to the home fronts, from the big battles in the East and the West to violent upheavals after 1918, Leonhard&#x2019;s treatment of the war is wide-ranging while also giving ample space to the different layers of war experiences.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Robert Gerwarth, University College Dublin, author of <i>The Vanquished: Why the First World War Failed to End</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A brilliant history of what people thought about the First World War&#x2015;before, during and after.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Beatrice Heuser</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Higher Education</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[A] very readable history of the war; thankfully, it is far more than a list of battles, but a thoughtful consideration of the epic destructive event in all its varied ramifications...There are more books on the First World War than anyone (even enthusiasts) could read, but Leonhard&#x2019;s is an honorable addition, a large and weighty volume, literally and metaphorically, that is well worth the time dipping into.

Visit her website at www.tessgerritsen.com.Chapter One<br><br> They looked like the perfect family.<br><br> This was what the boy thought as he stood beside his father&#x2019;s open grave, as he listened to the hired minister read platitudes from the Bible. Only a small group had gathered on that warm and buggy June day to mourn the passing of Montague Saul, no more than a dozen people, many of whom the boy had just met. For the past six months, he had been away at boarding school, and today he was seeing some of these people for the very first time. Most of them did not interest him in the least.<br><br> But his uncle&#x2019;s family&#x2014;they interested him very much. They were worth studying.<br><br> Dr. Peter Saul looked very much like his dead brother Montague, slender and cerebral in owlish glasses, brown hair thinning toward inevitable baldness. His wife, Amy, had a round, sweet face, and she kept darting anxious looks at her fifteen-year-old nephew, as though aching to wrap her arms around him and smother him with a hug. Their son, Teddy, was ten years old, all skinny arms and legs. A little clone of Peter Saul, right down to the same owlish glasses.<br><br> Finally, there was the daughter, Lily. Sixteen years old.<br><br> Tendrils of her hair had come loose from the ponytail and now clung to her face in the heat. She looked uncomfortable in her black dress, and she kept shifting coltishly back and forth, as though preparing to bolt. As though she&#x2019;d rather be anywhere than in this cemetery, waving away buzzing insects.<br><br> They look so normal, so average, the boy thought. So different from me. Then Lily&#x2019;s gaze suddenly met his, and he felt a tremor of surprise. Of mutual recognition. In that instant, he could almost feel her gaze penetrating the darkest fissures of his brain, examining all the secret places that no one else had ever seen. That he&#x2019;d never allowed them to see.<br><br> Disquieted, he looked away. Focused, instead, on the other people standing around the grave: His father&#x2019;s housekeeper. The attorney. The two next-door neighbors. Mere acquaintances who were here out of a sense of propriety, not affection. They knew Montague Saul only as the quiet scholar who&#x2019;d recently returned from Cyprus, who spent his days fussing over books and maps and little pieces of pottery. They did not really know the man. Just as they did not really know his son.<br><br> At last the service ended, and the gathering moved toward the boy, like an amoeba preparing to engulf him in sympathy, to tell him how sorry they were that he&#x2019;d lost his father. And so soon after moving to the United States.<br><br> &#x201c;At least you have family here to help you,&#x201d; said the minister.<br><br> Family? Yes, I suppose these people are my family, the boy thought, as little Teddy shyly approached, urged forward by his mother.<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to be my brother now,&#x201d; said Teddy.<br><br> &#x201c;Am I?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Mom has your room all ready for you. It&#x2019;s right next to mine.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m staying here. In my father&#x2019;s house.&#x201d;<br><br> Bewildered, Teddy looked at his mother. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t he coming home with us?&#x201d;<br><br> Amy Saul quickly said, &#x201c;You really can&#x2019;t live all by yourself, dear. You&#x2019;re only fifteen. Maybe you&#x2019;ll like it so much in Purity, you&#x2019;ll want to stay with us.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;My school&#x2019;s in Connecticut.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, but the school year&#x2019;s over now. In September, if you want to return to your boarding school, of course you can. But for the summer, you&#x2019;ll come home with us.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t be alone here. My mother will come for me.&#x201d;<br><br> There was a long silence. Amy and Peter looked at each other, and the boy could guess what they were thinking. His mother abandoned him ages ago.<br><br> &#x201c;She is coming for me,&#x201d; he insisted.<br><br> Uncle Peter said, gently, &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll talk about it later, son.&#x201d;<br><br> In the night, the boy laid awake in his bed, in his father&#x2019;s town house, listening to the voices of his aunt and uncle murmuring downstairs in the study. The same study where Montague Saul had labored these past months to translate his fragile little scraps of papyrus. The same study where, five days ago, he&#x2019;d had a stroke and collapsed at his desk. Those people should not be in there, among his father&#x2019;s precious things. They were invaders in his house.<br><br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s still just a boy, Peter. He needs a family.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t exactly drag him back to Purity if he doesn&#x2019;t want to come with us.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;When you&#x2019;re only fifteen, you have no choice in the matter. Adults have to make the decisions.&#x201d;<br><br> The boy rose from bed and slipped out of his room. He crept halfway down the stairs to listen in to the conversation.<br><br> &#x201c;And really, how many adults has he known? Your brother didn&#x2019;t exactly qualify. He was so wrapped up in his old mummy linens, he probably never noticed there was a child underfoot.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not fair, Amy. My brother was a good man.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Good, but clueless. I can&#x2019;t imagine what kind of woman would dream of having a child with him. And then she leaves the boy behind for Monty to raise? I don&#x2019;t understand any woman who&#x2019;d do that.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Monty didn&#x2019;t do such a bad job raising him. The boy&#x2019;s getting top marks in school.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s your measurement for what makes a good father? The fact that the boy gets top marks?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s also a poised young man. Look how well he held up at the service.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s numb, Peter. Did you see a single emotion on his face today?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Monty was like that, too.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Cold-blooded, you mean?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No, intellectual. Logical.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But underneath it all, you know that boy has got to be hurting. It makes me want to cry, how much he needs his mother right now. How he keeps insisting she&#x2019;ll come back for him, when we know she won&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t know that.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve never even met the woman! Monty just writes us from Cairo one day, to tell us he has a brand-new son. For all we know, he plucked him up from the reeds, like baby Moses.&#x201d;<br><br> The boy heard the floor creak above him, and he glanced toward the top of the stairs. He was startled to see his cousin Lily staring down at him over the banister. She was watching him, studying him, as if he were some exotic creature she&#x2019;d never before encountered and she was trying to decide if he was dangerous.<br><br> &#x201c;Oh!&#x201d; said Aunt Amy. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re up!&#x201d;<br><br> His aunt and uncle had just come out of the study, and they were standing at the bottom of the stairs, looking up at him. Looking a little dismayed, too, at the possibility that he had overheard their entire conversation.<br><br> &#x201c;Are you feeling all right, dear?&#x201d; said Amy.<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, Auntie.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s so late. Maybe you should go back to bed now?&#x201d;<br><br> But he didn&#x2019;t move. He paused on the stairs for a moment, wondering what it would be like to live with these people. What he might learn from them. It would make the summer interesting, until his mother came for him.<br><br> He said, &#x201c;Aunt Amy, I&#x2019;ve made up my mind.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;About what?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;About my summer, and where I&#x2019;d like to spend it.&#x201d;<br><br> She instantly assumed the worst. &#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t be too hasty! We have a really nice house, right on the lake, and you&#x2019;d have your own room. At least come for a visit before you decide.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But I&#x2019;ve decided to come stay with you.&#x201d;<br><br> His aunt paused, temporarily stunned. Then her face lit up in a smile, and she hurried up the steps to give him a hug. She smelled like Dove soap and Breck shampoo. So average, so ordinary. Then a grinning Uncle Peter gave him an affectionate clap on the shoulder, his way of welcoming a new son. Their happiness was like a web of spun sugar, drawing him into their universe, where all was love and light and laughter.<br><br> &#x201c;The kids will be so glad you&#x2019;re coming back with us!&#x201d; said Amy.<br><br> He glanced toward the top of the stairs, but Lily was no longer there. She had slipped away, unnoticed. I will have to keep my eye on her, he thought. Because already, she&#x2019;s keeping her eye on me.<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re part of our family now,&#x201d; said Amy.<br><br> As they walked up the stairs together, she was already telling him her plans for the summer. All the places they&#x2019;d take him, all the special meals they&#x2019;d cook for him when they got back home. She sounded happy, even giddy, like a mother with her brand-new baby.<br><br> Amy Saul had no idea what they were about to bring home with them.</p><h2>The Great Escape</h2><p>With only their bare hands and the crudest of homemade tools, they sank shafts, built underground railroads, forged passports, drew maps, faked weapons, and tailored German uniforms and civilian clothes.<br><br>They developed a fantastic security system to protect themselves from the German "ferrets" who prowled the compounds with nerve-racking tenacity and suspicion.<br><br>It was a split-second operation as delicate and as deadly as a time bomb.

It comes with six full-size template drawings from which it is possible to make at least nine different wood-strip (hence the name "Stripper") and fiberglass canoes and kayaks. The drawings are basic designs for recreational, cargo, and flatwater racing canoes, as well as a two-place kayak that can be made in a recreational, broad-beam version or in a narrow-beam version for the more skilled paddler. <p>A wood-strip canoe is a ribless boat made from narrow wood strips covered with clear epoxy and fiberglass inside and out. This laminated construction produces a rigid, light weight, sleek, and beautiful boat. A canoe project, the author estimates, would take an amateur 150 man-hours of work. Even mediocre craftsmanship can produce a boat superior to most factory-made boats.</p></p><p>First published in 1972 when polyester resins were in vogue, the book has been revised several times, and now only discusses the use of epoxy. Hazen&#39;s methods and designs are &#34;middle-of-the-road&#34; between the simple functionality of some texts and the complex elegance of others. All the hulls are built without stems; the entry and exit waterlines are finely tapered; and the strips are laid parallel to the waterline.From 6 pages of full-size template drawings and the instructions in this book you can make a recreational canoe with a 34&#34; width in lengths from 16&#39; to 18&#39;; a 36&#34; width, 18&#39; touring canoe; a 48&#34; width, 20&#39; cargo canoe; a 27&#34; width racing canoe in lengths from 14&#39; to 18&#39;; or two models of 2-man touring kayaks, 25&#34; by 20&#39;, and 28&#34; by 18&#39;.</p><h2>Demon Knights Vol. 3: The Gathering Storm (The New 52)</h2><p>Acclaimed writer Paul Cornell sends the Demon Knights to Hell in this third installment in the series!<br><br>Betrayed by Etrigan and trapped in Hell, the Demon Knights must find a way to escape the clutches of Lucifer.

After reporting a series of strange and upsetting events that have happened to him in his new parish, Father Higgins disappears and the trail leads Johnny and the Professor to Glastonbury, England. There they meet the diabolical Rufus Masterman, whom the Professor recognizes as Father Higgins under the control of an evil spirit. Just how evil is soon made clear as Johnny, his friend Fergie, the Professor, and the Professor's brother Humphrey follow the few clues they have to the island of Lundy in the Bristol Channel. There, Masterman intends to locate and reanimate the bodies of seven evil brother knights who sold their souls to the devil in ancient times. As usual, Bellairs moves things along briskly, with enough chills to satisfy readers not quite ready for Stephen King. Characters are drawn with broad brush strokes, and new readers will soon know as much as old fans about the irascible but wise Professor Childermass, dependable Fergie, and loyal Johnny, whose sense of duty gives him the courage to face danger. Where Bellairs's other books are popular, this will be a welcome addition. --Elaine Fort Weischedel, Turner Free Library, Randolph, MA<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Lily in Full Bloom (Disney Fairies) (A Stepping Stone Book(TM))</h2><p>This blooming good story is the 18th book in our popular Disney Fairies chapter book series, which features Tinker Bell's adventures in Never Land with her fairy friends. <br><br>Lily has always thought of herself as a garden-talent fairy first and foremost.

To Taylor, self-fulfillment, although often expressed in self-centered ways, isn't necessarily a rejection of traditional values and social commitment; it also reflects something authentic and valuable in modern culture. Only by distinguishing what is good in this modern striving from what is socially and politically dangerous, Taylor says, can our age be made to deliver its promise.</p></p><p>Charles Taylor is emeritus professor of philosophy at McGill University.

Campaigning along the eastern seaboard, they are pitted against General William Howe and his superbly trained and better provisioned British forces. The inspired Americans make a good showing at the battles of Brandywine Creek and Germantown, but in the end they absorb two disappointing defeats. The atrocities suffered by the Americans in the &#34;Paoli Massacre&#34; and the political machinations of the ambitious American officers Horatio Gates and Thomas Conway set the stage for the darkest hour of the entire Revolution--the heartbreaking story of Valley Forge. Suffering from disease, hunkered down in crude huts and struggling to survive the bitter winter weather, the downtrodden American soldiers lack everything needed to sustain life, especially food. In a letter addressed to Congress, General Washington decries the government&#39;s failure to provide relief, describing his men as occupying &#34;a cold, bleak hill,&#34; sleeping &#34;under frost and snow without clothes or blankets.&#34; Into this deplorable setting comes the flamboyant Baron Friederich von Steuben. With Washington&#39;s blessing, the eccentric German officer instills a measure of military discipline and pride in the ragtag American army. Then, having survived the terrible winter and now better equipped and fed, the rejuvenated Americans march out of Valley Forge in June 1778, a new and inspired army. Continuing to follow the personal fortunes of the now familiar characters Billy Weems, Eli Stroud, Mary Flint, and Caleb Dunson, author Ron Carter extends his vivid portrayal of the hardships, disappointments, struggles, and triumphs that were part of the epic struggle to win freedom and liberty for America.</p><p>Ron Carter graduated from Brigham Young University and attended law school at George Washington University and the University of Utah. He retired as research and writing director for the Superior Court system in Los Angeles County, California, in 1999. To date, his books include volumes 1 through 7 of the &#34;Prelude to Glory&#34; series (volume 7 is soon to release in July of 2003), the humorous &#34;Settlement&#34; series, and The Clearwater Union War&#34;. He and his wife, LaRae, live in Park City, Utah, and have nine Children.</p><h2>Winter: A Novel of a Berlin Family</h2><p>Peter and Pauli Winter are two very different brothers born into a time when the horrors of war engulf and extinguish the Germany that is. Yet for all their differences, the destinies of the two brothers are forever bound to the madness that lies ahead. From their sheltered childhood through their violent coming of age in the Great War . . . from the chaos of 1920 Berlin to the spreading power of Hitler . . . the brothers are wrenched apart by conflicting ideals and ambitions. Now mortal enemies, they are trapped in a holocaust that threatens to tear them -- and the world -- to pieces.</p><p><p>Born in London, Len Deighton served in the RAF before graduating from the Royal College of Art (which recently elected him a Senior Fellow). While in New York City working as a magazine illustrator he began writing his first novel, The Ipcress File, which was published in 1962. He is now the author of more than thirty books of fiction and non-fiction. At present living in Europe, he has, over the years, lived with his family in ten different countries from Austria to Portugal.</p>Modern history and suspenseful fiction are here brilliantly combined by a master of both. The plot revolves around two brothers, sons of a wealthy Berlin banker and his American wife, whose conflicting destinies are the means by which Deighton (Blitzkrieg, The Ipcress File) tells the story of Germany from 1900 to the end of World War II. Peter Winter, who flies zeppelins in World War I, becomes a staunch anti-Nazi and then a colonel in the American Army; Paul, charming, ambitious and psychologically flawed, becomes a top legal adviser to the Nazi regime. They finally confront each other at Nuremberg. Though Paul is not entirely convincing as a basically "nice" Nazi, who has conscience enough to save his brother's Jewish wife yet gives spurious legal sanction to Hitler's atrocities without a qualm, both he and his brother are handy pegs on which Deighton hangs accurate, exciting and cleverly selected dollops of social, political and front-line military history, while highlighting the tensions between Prussian and Bavarian, Wehrmacht and SS that hastened the nation's rush toward suicide. 100,000 first printing; BOMC alternate. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Fire in the Belly: On Being a Man</h2><p>Written for both men and women, this groundbreaking book takes the reader on a journey to discover new routes to authentic manhood and create alternatives to definitions of masculinity that no longer work in today&#39;s world.</p><p><b>Sam Keen</b> is a noted author and lecturer who has written thirteen books on philosophy and religion.

Henry had died even before Eleanor, but he still had not won admission into Heaven. Waiting with Eleanor are Henry's mother, Matilda-Empress, and William the Marshal. A chance encounter with Abbot Suger, an old friend of Eleanor's from the time of her first marriage, starts the four of them remembering times past. Each person in turn tells a part of Eleanor's life, vividly illustrating the excitement of living in twelfth-century England and France, and especially the excitement of being Eleanor. Wife of two kings, mother of two others, Richard the Lion Heart and John, she set the tone of court life for her times, sponsored poets and musicians, established the legend of King Arthur as a romantic feature of English literature, set the Rules of Courtly Love, and helped rule a kingdom that spanned from Scotland to the Pyrenees.

She has been involved with pottery for more than 30 years, has been published in <i>Ceramics Monthly</i>, and has written on pottery for <i>Garden Way</i> and <i>Mother Earth News</i>. She writes a regular column, "Face Out: Notes of a College Bookseller" for the College Store Journal, and has also written for <i>Fine Gardening</i>, <i>Old Farmer's Almanac</i>, and <i>Parents</i>.Staubach, a potter and freelance writer, successfully communicates the passion she feels for her material (both literal and literary) in this extensively researched overview of clay. What is this ubiquitous stuff? It began as granite, which over millions of years was ground down by rain, sleet, snow and chemical forces into what we now know as clay. The first known clay objects were small religious figures, followed by pottery vessels, in Neolithic times. The oldest such pottery known was produced by the Joman peoples of Japan. In addition to an informed discussion of clay ovens used by various cultures over time, the author compares these cultures' designs as pottery grew to be an art form. Ancient Greeks, for example, created a unique appearance by controlling the atmosphere of their kilns. Clay, Staubach says, has served many purposes: clay tablets were used for the earliest writing; it also became the key ingredient for building houses and, in modern times, sewer pipes and flush toilets. Some sections of this account will be of most interest to potters, pottery aficionados or those with an interest in earth science, but Staubach leavens her facts with captivating anecdotes throughout.

The entries are organized by family groups-an incredible 82 are included-according to the American Ornithological Union guidelines. Within a family, each separate bird entry has dozens of tips and illustrations on species' genders, age groups, behavior, habitats, nesting and feeding habits, and migration routes. Readers will also find unique features, such as:<ul><li>A quick-find index for the most common bird groups and a full glossary</li><li>Straightforward, accessible text by numerous birding experts, including National Geographic's resident birding consultant Jonathan Alderfer</li><li>Hundreds of range and migration maps from renowned ornithologist Paul Lehman with National Geographic cartographers</li><li>State-of-the-art, updated bird illustrations by expert artists, including Jonathan Alderfer</li><li>New and original photographs from well-known bird photographers Kevin Karlson and Brian Small</li></ul><br><br>Perfect for novice or experienced birders alike, <i>National Geographic Complete Book of Birds</i> is a definitive, must-have resource. Quite simply, there is no other volume like it.</p><p>Jonathan Alderfer, a widely published author and field guide illustrator, is well known in the birding community for his expertise as a field ornithologist and his knowledge of North American birds. He has served as a general consultant and an art consultant for the <i>National Geographic Field Guide to the Birds of North America</i> (4th edition) and is the Associate Editor of <i>Birding,</i> the magazine of the American Birding Association.*Starred Review* Birders rejoice! National Geographic has come through once again with a volume that libraries and bird enthusiasts will welcome to their shelves. Ornithologist and illustrator Alderfer is the general editor of this fine resource that, as he acknowledges, is too large to be a field guide, although many may throw it in their bags while birding. Described as a "companion to the <i>National Geographic Field Guide to the Birds of North America,</i>" the book pulls together a remarkable amount of information into what can only be described as one of the finest one-volume reference works ever published on North American birds.<p>The organization will be familiar to bird aficionados everywhere. Each of the 82 avian families is treated in an individual section that begins with a brief essay covering the special characteristics of the family in terms of structure, behavior, plumage, distribution, taxonomy, and conservation. Each genus is then taken in turn; 962 species in total are described. Species entries include outstanding illustrations of each distinctive phase, gender, variant, and subspecies where such illustrations will provide assistance in identification. Clear and updated distribution maps are included. Occasional sidebars offer information on differentiating similar species and subspecies as well as other interesting details about a particular bird or group of birds. Directly aimed at helping birders, the text for each species pays special attention to distinctive characteristics and offers helpful advice for identification. Comprehensiveness is excellent, and there is no reason to doubt the editor's claim that the book includes every resident and established variant through September 2005. </p><p>Alderfer and National Geographic have produced a volume that, though certainly not as comprehensive as Cornell University's <i>Birds of North America</i> [http://bna.birds.cornell.edu/BNA], rivals and often surpasses the Audubon <i>Society's Sibley Guide to Birds</i> (Knopf, 2000).

When Rose's father makes her a sled for Christmas, she is overjoyed. Then she discovers that Abe's little brother has received nothing as both his parents are dead. Can she sacrifice her joy for Swiney? The characters are finely drawn; the era and the setting are alive as well.

It also was deeply admired by Herman Melville, Dana&#x2019;s most famous literary confidante.&amp;&amp;LBR&amp;&amp;R&nbsp;&amp;&amp;LBR&amp;&amp;RDana eventually became a lawyer, devoting himself to fighting for the rights of sailors&#x2015;and slaves&#x2015;in court.

Richard Henry Dana is only nineteen when he abandons the patrician world of Boston and Harvard for an arduous voyage among real sailors, amid genuine danger. The result is an astonishing read, replete with vivid descriptions of storms, whales, and the ship&#39;s mad captain, terrible hardship and magical beauty, and fascinating historical detail, including an intriguing portrait of California before the gold rush.

Some became destitute, a few went insane. But many went back to school in the heyday of the Women?s Liberation movement, and were swept up in the promise of equality for both sexes.

Gail Carson Levine and her husband, David, live in a two-centuries-old farmhouse in the Hudson Valley of New York State.</p>Reviewed with Gail Carson Levine's <i>For Biddle's Sake</i>. <p>Gr. 3-5. Once upon a time, when a young girl asked a librarian for a princess book, she meant a traditional fairy tale featuring a princess. Now, as likely as not, she wants a book from Levine's series the Princess Tales, small volumes that borrow elements from folk-tales to create lively, new stories. In <i>Fairy's Return</i>, a princess falls in love with the third son of a baker, a young man whose jokes make her laugh. With both parents resisting the marriage, it takes determination, imagination, and the intervention of a wish-granting fairy to bring this couple to the point of "happily ever after." <i>For Biddle's Sake</i> introduces Parsley, a sweet-natured girl raised by the fairy Bombina, who struggles with an obsessive drive to turn people into toads. After many years of relative control, she flies into a fit of rage and transforms her beloved Parsley. Only a marriage proposal from a human can return Parsley to her previous form. A few black-and-white drawings illustrate the stories, but the real draw of these attractively designed books is the inventive use of folkloric elements woven into charming, original stories. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The grandmother is Swedish, a retired domestic. The boy is Ethiopian and adopted, and he will grow up to become the world-renowned chef Marcus Samuelsson. This book is his love letter to food and family in all its manifestations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> Marcus Samuelsson was only three years old when he, his mother, and his sister&#x2014;all battling tuberculosis&#x2014;walked seventy-five miles to a hospital in the Ethiopian capital city of Addis Adaba. Tragically, his mother succumbed to the disease shortly after she arrived, but Marcus and his sister recovered, and one year later they were welcomed into a loving middle-class white family in G�teborg, Sweden. It was there that Marcus&#x2019;s new grandmother, Helga, sparked in him a lifelong passion for food and cooking with her pan-fried herring, her freshly baked bread, and her signature roast chicken. From a very early age, there was little question what Marcus was going to be when he grew up.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Yes, Chef </i>chronicles Marcus Samuelsson&#x2019;s remarkable journey from Helga&#x2019;s humble kitchen to some of the most demanding and cutthroat restaurants in Switzerland and France, from his grueling stints on cruise ships to his arrival in New York City, where his outsize talent and ambition finally come together at Aquavit, earning him a coveted <i>New York Times </i>three-star rating at the age of twenty-four. But Samuelsson&#x2019;s career of&nbsp; &#x201c;chasing flavors,&#x201d; as he calls it, had only just begun&#x2014;in the intervening years, there have been White House state dinners, career crises, reality show triumphs and, most important, the opening of the beloved Red Rooster in Harlem. At Red Rooster, Samuelsson has fufilled his dream of creating a truly diverse, multiracial dining room&#x2014;a place where presidents and prime ministers rub elbows with jazz musicians, aspiring artists, bus drivers, and nurses. It is a place where an orphan from Ethiopia, raised in Sweden, living in America, can feel at home. <br> &nbsp;<br> With disarming honesty and intimacy, Samuelsson also opens up about his failures&#x2014;the price of ambition, in human terms&#x2014;and recounts his emotional journey, as a grown man, to meet the father he never knew. <i>Yes, Chef </i>is a tale of personal discovery, unshakable determination, and the passionate, playful pursuit of flavors&#x2014;one man&#x2019;s struggle to find a place for himself in the kitchen, and in the world.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Yes, Chef</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br>&#x201c;Such an interesting life, told with touching modesty and remarkable candor.&#x201d;&#x2014;Ruth Reichl<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Marcus Samuelsson has an incomparable story, a quiet bravery, and a lyrical and discreetly glittering style&#x2014;in the kitchen and on the page.

He offers instead a passionate empathy with the ordinary dreams and aspirations of his characters, a brilliant ear for the urban vernacular and for the voices of conscience and self-deceit that torment his characters.<br>"Selby's place is in the front rank of American novelists ... to understand his work is to understand the anguish of America."?<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>Hubert Selby, Jr. was born in Brooklyn in 1928.

The neighbor&#39;s monkey was liable to escape and run across your roof. Surfing was conducted by driving cars across the breakwater. Lizards and firecrackers made frequent contact. Carlos Eire&#39;s childhood was a little different from most. His father was convinced he had been Louis XVI in a past life. At school, classmates with fathers in the Batista government were attended by chauffeurs and bodyguards. At a home crammed with artifacts and paintings, portraits of Jesus spoke to him in dreams and nightmares. Then, in January 1959, the world changed: Batista was suddenly gone, a cigar-smoking guerrilla took his place, and Christmas was cancelled. The echo of firing squads was everywhere. And, one by one, the author&#39;s schoolmates begin to disappear - spirited away to the United States. Carlos would end up there himself, without his parents, never to see his father again. Narrated with the urgency of a confession, Waiting for Snow in Havana is both an ode to a paradise lost and an exorcism. More than that, it captures the terrible beauty of those times when we are certain we have died - and then are somehow, miraculously, reborn.</p><p></p><h2>Children of Summer: Henri Fabre&#39;s Insects</h2><p>"Paul, 10, is fascinated by insects, an interest engendered by his father, Henri Fabre, who has studied the creatures for most of his life.

Paul, 10, is fascinated by insects, an interest engendered by his father, Henri Fabre, who has studied the creatures for most of his life. The boy and his two younger sisters help Pere gather material for a textbook, often accompanying him on field trips into their untamed backyard. Children of Summer briefly describes over a dozen of their scientific adventures from altering the path of a group of pine caterpillars, to studying the behavior of undertaker beetles and ground wasps. There is much that is admirable in this slim title. The text is clearly written and the material on insect behavior is intriguing, particularly the responses of various species to the experiments. Soft pen-and-pencil drawings of the family and the small creatures they study, plus the occasional silhouette, evoke the book's 19th-century French setting. Henri Fabre's voice dominates the narrative; Paul merely passes on his father's observations and findings. Indeed, several of the short chapters included are straight reminiscences of the man's childhood?e.g., how Henri taught himself to read and how his duck-herding activities inspired his love of nature. In the original works on which this title is based, the 10 volume Souvenirs Entomologiques, Fabre himself spoke directly to his readers in a charming, if verbose style. Anderson's book will nonetheless appeal to serious young naturalists curious about the work of a famous and idiosyncratic scientist.?Karey Wehner, San Francisco Public Library<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.A fictionalized look at the work of entomologist Jean Henri Fabre, as seen through the eyes of his 10-year-old son, Paul. Working largely in the fields around his French home, and often with the help of his children, Fabre (d. 1915) pioneered the study of insect behavior; Anderson (Food Chains, 1991, etc.) sketches the scientist's career and introduces a gallery of his multilegged subjects. With chatty enthusiasm, Paul describes his father's simple maneuvers, e.g., pinning a ball of dung to the ground to see how dung beetles go about freeing it, and observations, capturing the excitement of waking to a house full of giant male peacock moths drawn by a newly hatched female caged in the study, gamely sitting down to a meal of cooked cossus grubs, considered a delicacy by the ancient Romans, or pausing to hear an anecdote from his father's youth. The incidents are all true, recast from Fabre's books for adults and arranged in short, easy-to-absorb chapters; young naturalists charmed by these glimpses into a lilliputian world will want to sample Fabre's own accounts.

The style transformed the decorative arts of many countries at a moment when Western culture believed itself to be on the brink of enormous change. Being ultramodern in the 1890s meant moving away from classical standards of beauty to create a sophisticated blend of nature and artifice. It also meant finding fresh inspiration in art history (Gothic architectural ornament, the airy curlicues of rococo art), non-European cultures (flat patterning in Japanese woodcuts, whiplash curves in Islamic art), or native folk art traditions. <p> Authoritative and elegantly written essays by 22 specialists, illustrated with 507 sumptuous photographs, make <i>Art Nouveau, 1890-1914</i> one of the finest art books in recent memory. Produced to accompany a major exhibition that opened at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum in London and runs at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., from October 8, 2000, through January 28, 2001, this volume is the first to illuminate the full range of art nouveau media and the complex connections--scientific, literary, mystical, mythological, psychological, industrial, nationalistic--that allowed it to take root in Europe and the U.S. </p><p> The famous art nouveau figures are all represented, of course: architects and designers Charles Rennie Macintosh, Victor Horta, Hector Guimard, Josef Hoffmann, Antonio Gaud�; art glass wizards Louis Comfort Tiffany and �mile Gall�; illustrators Aubrey Beardsley and Alphonse Mucha. But part of the pleasure of this book consists in discovering exquisite or bizarre pieces by lesser-known designers empowered by the dark sensuality of a style that perversely borrowed from nature to celebrate the nervous energy of urban culture. <i>--Cathy Curtis</i></p>Paul Greenhalgh is President of the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design.

Sylvia Frey contends that the military struggle there involved a triangle--two sets of white belligerents and approximately 400,000 slaves. She reveals the dialectical relationships between slave resistance and Britain's Southern Strategy and between slave resistance and the white independence movement among Southerners, and shows how how these relationships transformed religion, law, and the economy during the postwar years.</p></p><p>&#39;Frey&#39;s broad research, skillful synthesis, sensitivity, and insight fill her work with a subtle power that demands reading by anyone seriously interested in blacks, American religion, the South, or the Revolutionary era.&#39; - Library JournalBlack readiness to rebel changed the context of Southern life in the American Revolution and turned the war in the South into a war about slavery, Frey shows. Tracking the directions and dynamics of the change, she follows the currents of a persistent black liberation movement that proved central to the Revolutionary struggle in the South and pivotal for the slave system and the larger society from the 1760s to the 1800s. Frey emphasizes African American initiatives and responses that fostered what she sees as a dual transformation in law and religion, giving shape to Southern evangelical Christianity and the hegemony of the slaveholding class. Frey's broad research, skillful syn thesis, sensitivity, and insight fill her work with a subtle power that demands reading by anyone seriously interested in blacks, American religion, the South, or the Revolutionary era.

Eliot Ness, fresh from his legendary Chicago triumph over Al Capone and associates, set his sights on Cleveland and went on a crusade that matched, and sometimes even surpassed, his past accomplishments. Dismembered body parts have started washing up in a concentrated area of Lake Erie Sound. Their headless torsos have left no clues to their identity or the reason for death. Elliot Ness and his colorful gang of "The Unknowns" chased this killer through the underbelly of Cleveland for years. As far as the public was concerned he was never captured. But what really happened is even more shocking. This award-winning collection includes a historic photo essay of the actual murders. Torso was nominated for an International Horror Guild award for best graphic story and for 3 International Eagle Awards. <br></p><p></p><h2>Star Trek: Mirror Universe: Shards and Shadows</h2><p>Fractured history.

To taste it is to lose oneself in a world of startling familiarity and terrifying contradictions, where everything and everyone we knew is somehow disturbingly different, and where shocking secrets await their revelation. <br> <br> What began in 2007 with Glass Empires and Obsidian Alliances -- the first truly in-depth foray into the turbulent history of this other continuum -- now continues in twelve new short tales that revisit and expand upon that so-called "Mirror Universe," spanning all five of the core incarnations of Star Trek, as well as their literary offshoots, across more than two hundred years of divergent history, as chronicled by... <br> <br> Christopher L.

The Terran Empire has possession of a powerful weapon, the twenty-third-century Federation Starship Defiant ("In a Mirror Darkly,"</i> Star Trek: Enterprise; <i>"Mirror, Mirror,"</i> Star Trek<i>). The Empress Sato, having mercilessly destroyed the usurpers to her rule (</i>Star Trek Mirror Universe: Glass Empires -- Age of the Empress<i>), now seeks to eradicate any rebellion.</i></p><p>He dreamed of T'Pol.</p><p>Not the Regent she had become but the woman she had been. The woman he had loved, out of duty at first and then with all his heart. He pictured her as she had looked ten years ago, at the time of the Empress's ascension, wearing the uniform she had taken from the <i>Defiant</i>'s stores, a blue skirt that let her long legs show, that left the curve of her neck bare.</p><p>He pictured himself kissing that skin, felt her long hair brush against his face, felt his hands moving over her body, her yielding to him. He luxuriated in the moment, stayed with T'Pol as she had been for as long as he could stand the memory.</p><p>And then the memory faded, and for a second, he saw T'Pol as she was now, T'Pol the Regent, hard, harsh, close-cropped hair. He pictured her standing over him, her face blank, expressionless, emotionless. Alien. Vulcan. As if they had shared nothing. As if he were nothing more to her than another cog in the Empress's machine.</p><p>He saw her hands reaching for him. Her fi ngertips on his forehead. Her mind invading his. Her strength forcing him to yield.</p><p>He shot up in bed, suddenly awake. Drenched in sweat.</p><p>Completely disoriented.</p><p>He wasn't aboard <i>Defiant</i>. He was -- where?</p><p>Wearing a hospital gown. A hospital bed. Dim lighting in the room, a small room, no windows, a door at the foot of his bed, ventilators humming...</p><p>The door cracked open. Lights -- dimmed, thank God for that -- came on.</p><p>Dr. Phlox walked in.</p><p>"You." Tucker hated the Denubolan with a passion. "Where am I?"</p><p>"I'd take it easy if I were you, Commander. Your body needs time to recover from the -- "</p><p>"Answer the damn question."</p><p>Phlox smiled.</p><p>"You're in a private medical facility. On Earth."</p><p>"Earth? How did I get here?"</p><p>Tucker shook his head. Images fl ashed through his mind. He was out on <i>Defiant</i>, near the Neutral Zone, hunting the rebels. Hunting Archer.</p><p>"I want that man caught!" Robinson yelled, slamming his fist into the padded armrest of the captain's chair. "I want more speed!"</p><p>He turned and glared at Tucker.</p><p>"I want my ship!" he screamed, and his face morphed into Hoshi's. The Empress's.</p><p>Tucker blinked, returning to the here and now.</p><p>"There was an accident," Phlox said. "In engineering."</p><p>"I don't remember that at all."</p><p>"Not surprising. It was rather a large explosion. You've been unconscious for some time."</p><p>"Some time."</p><p>"Three weeks."</p><p>"Three weeks? What about the ship?" Tucker asked.</p><p>"The ship is functional."</p><p>"Functional. What does that mean?"</p><p>"There is time to worry about the ship later," Phlox said. "For now, I need to examine you."</p><p>The doctor moved closer to the bed. Tucker flinched.</p><p>"I'd rather have another doctor."</p><p>"You don't get a choice. The Empress has personally charged me with your care."</p><p>Ah. Tucker could guess how that conversation had gone.</p><p>Heal him, or else.</p><p>He gritted his teeth, and endured the doctor's none-too-gentle probing. His machines and his tests. At the end, Phlox stepped back.</p><p>"So?" Tucker asked. "How am I?"</p><p>The doctor shook his head. "Dying," Phlox said.<br></p><p>Something to do with delta rays and radiation. The <i>Defiant</i>'s warp engines and the explosion that had occurred. Impending CCB -- catastrophic cellular breakdown.</p><p>A more extreme version of the energies that had scarred his face at Bozeman, at the warp training facility, twenty years ago.</p><p>"Fix me," Tucker said. "The Empress charged you with my care, right?"</p><p>"Believe me, I am well aware of that fact. There is nothing I can do, however."</p><p>Tucker sat up. Frowned. "I don't feel any pain."</p><p>"It will be minimal at first," Phlox said. "As the nerve endings deteriorate, however, you will begin to -- "</p><p>"Spare me the gory details." Tucker glared, rubbed the small of his back. "I hope this isn't another one of your sick jokes."</p><p>"Hardly."</p><p>"Maybe I should get a second opinion."</p><p>"A second opinion." Phlox burst out laughing and, just as suddenly, stopped. "Get all the opinions you want, Commander. The Empress would certainly love to have you with us for as long as possible. But the data are irrefutable. Machines do not lie."</p><p>There was a rolling cart next to the bed; on it, a case lay open. A machine lay within the case, the last machine the doctor had used. He popped a data chip out of the machine and put it into Tucker's hand.</p><p>"So, what kind of time frame we talking about?" Tucker asked.</p><p>"A few weeks. Perhaps longer. Depending."</p><p>"On what?"</p><p>"On the speed of the breakdown. How fast the effect travels through your system." The doctor retracted cable, folded sensors, snapped the case shut. "If I were you, I would get my affairs in order. Sooner rather than later."</p><p>He picked the case up by a handle, nodded, and left.</p><p>Tucker got out of bed. A mirror, three feet square, occupied one wall of the room. He went and looked at himself in it.</p><p>His body was scarred all over, burned. New scars to go with the old ones, the ones running down the side of his face. Souvenirs from Bozeman and the years he'd spent slaving next to the reactor chambers of various starships. <i>Enterprise</i>. <i>Defiant</i>. And -- </p><p>Pain stabbed into his head. Sudden, sharp, debilitating. He groaned, lowered his head, waited for it to pass. Eventually, it did.</p><p>He stood up, and the room stopped spinning after a moment.</p><p>He'd never felt pain like that before. Not even after Bozeman.</p><p><i>Dying</i>. Maybe Phlox was right.</p><p>He went to a terminal on the other side of the room. He popped in the data module Phlox had given him and reviewed what was on it. Started to, anyway. He was no doctor. He couldn't make heads or tails out of what he was seeing; it was highly unlikely, though, that Phlox had been lying. The Empress would have his head. Tucker was important to her -- or, rather, the knowledge in his head was important.</p><p>His stomach growled. He walked out the door and into the hall.</p><p>There was a guard there, of course. There were guards everywhere.</p><p>This one was a good half-meter taller than he, built like a walking mountain.</p><p>"You don't leave the room." He drew his weapon and motioned Tucker back inside.</p><p>"Food," Tucker said, and went back into the room. Ten minutes later, a tray showed up. Hospital crap. He ate it anyway.</p><p>He lay back on his bed, hands behind his head, and closed his eyes.<i></i></p><p><i>Dying.</i></p><p>When he'd never really had a chance to live.<br></p><p>He slept, and dreamed again. Of T'Pol at fi rst, not the T'Pol he had loved but the Regent, standing over his bed. Her fingers probing. Her mind probing.</p><p>The Empress stood next to her. Watching. Glaring.

However, there are a number of plants that manage to grow spontaneously in sidewalk cracks and roadside meridians, flourish along chain-link fences and railroad tracks, line the banks of streams and rivers, and emerge in the midst of landscape plantings and trampled lawns. On their own and free of charge, these plants provide ecological services including temperature reduction, oxygen production, carbon storage, food and habitat for wildlife, pollution mitigation, and erosion control on slopes. Around the world, wild plants help to make urban environments more habitable for people.</p><p>Peter Del Tredici's lushly illustrated field guide to wild urban plants of the northeastern United States is the first of its kind. While it covers the area bounded by Montreal, Boston, Washington, D.C. and Detroit, it is broadly applicable to temperate urban environments across North America. The book covers 222 species that flourish without human assistance or approval. Rather than vilifying such plants as weeds, Del Tredici stresses that it is important to notice, recognize, and appreciate their contribution to the quality of urban life. Indeed their very toughness in the face of heat islands, elevated levels of carbon dioxide and ubiquitous contamination is indicative of the important role they have to play in helping humans adapt to the challenges presented by urbanization, globalization and climate change. </p><p>The species accounts&#x2015;158 main entries plus 64 secondary species-feature descriptive information including scientific name and taxonomic authority, common names, botanical family, life form, place of origin, and identification features. Del Tredici focuses especially on their habitat preferences, environmental functions, and cultural significance. Each entry is accompanied by original full-color photographs by the author which show the plants' characteristics and growth forms in their typical habitats. Wild Urban Plants of the Northeast will help readers learn to see these plants-the natural vegetation of the urban environment-with fresh appreciation and understanding.</p></p><p>Peter Del Tredici is Senior Research Scientist at the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University and Lecturer in Landscape Architecture at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. He is author of <i>A Giant Among the Dwarfs</i>. He has been awarded the Veitch Memorial Medal by the Royal Horticultural Society.<p>"I grew up in the heart of the San Fernando Valley in the Los Angeles basin and developed an interest in plants while I was in high school. Unfortunately, I did not have a resource to identify and understand the naturalized and weedy plants of my environment. I would have found such a book a fabulous resource then and today and would certainly recommend it to those interesting in the magnificence of nature, yet living in urban environments. This is a great resource for urbanites to experience the fascination, complexity, and beauty of the plants that grow around them."</p> (Joseph M. DiTomaso, coauthor of Weeds of the Northeast and author of Weeds of California and Other Western States and Aquatic and Riparian Weeds of the West)<br><br><p>"Peter Del Tredici provides a unique perspective on the plants we find in our increasingly urbanized environment of the twenty-first century. Rather than dismissing the nonnative plant species that have been introduced into our city habitats, he portrays them as immigrants with a history and life of their own adapting to roadsides and abandoned parking lots. <i>Wild Urban Plants of the Northeast</i> is a must-read if we are to understand and appreciate the world's exotic biodiversity."</p> (W. John Kress, National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution)<br><br><p>"Both experienced and novice users will find <i>Wild Urban Plants of the Northeast</i> to be an excellent tool for plant identification. Each species is presented with user-friendly descriptions and photographs of important vegetative structures as well as photographs of the species within the urban landscape. This work contains a thought provoking introduction to urban plant communities that will serve as an entry point for investigation by scholars and practitioners alike. To some, these species may stand as symptoms of environmental degradation, but Del Tredici documents the case that the urban plant community has been evolving since the first human civilizations and that it is part of a sustainable solution to vegetation management problems in the urban landscape. Recognition is the first step toward acceptance. <i>Wild Urban Plants of the Northeast</i> is the first field guide to acknowledge the urban plant community around us and it challenges us to judge the plants on their virtues rather than by their place of origin. This work will be the foundation for those who wish to evaluate plant communities by their function and sustainability rather than by nativity alone. We cannot go back and undo the edaphic changes and disturbance regimes that exist in our urban environments. Why should we? <i>Wild Urban Plants of the Northeast</i> will lead us forward."</p> (Richard Uvaco, author of <i>Weeds of the Northeast</i>)<br><br><p>"Peter Del Tredici has written one of those rare books that completely overturns the way you look at the landscape?in this case, the landscape of the city's derelict cracks and corners, which in his hands becomes a place of unusual interest, value, and beauty. Though ostensibly a field guide, this book is much more than that?it offers a deep and wise reconsideration of our most cherished ideas about nature. You will never look at an 'invasive species' the same way again."</p> (Michael Pollan, author of <i>The Botany of Desire</i> and <i>The Omnivore's Dilemma</i>)</p><h2>Rick Steves England</h2><p><b>Hike the wild moors of Dartmoor, explore the scenic bays of Cornwall, and dive into history at Hadrian's Wall: with Rick Steves on your side, England can be yours!<br><br>Inside <i>Rick Steves England</i> you'll find:</b><br><ul><li><b>Comprehensive coverage</b> for spending <b>a week or more </b>exploring England</li><li><b>Rick's strategic advice</b> on how to get the most out of your time and money, with rankings of his must-see favorites</li><li><b>Top sights and hidden gems</b>, from the ancient and mysterious Stonehenge to cozy corner pubs</li><li><b>How to connect with local culture:</b> Catch the premier of a new musical, chat with fans about the latest football match, or take high tea in a classic hotel</li><li><b>Beat the crowds, skip the lines, and avoid tourist traps </b>with Rick's candid, humorous insight</li><li>The best places to eat, sleep, and relax over a pint</li><li><b>Self-guided walking tours</b> of lively neighborhoods and incredible museums </li><li><b>Detailed neighborhood maps </b>for exploring on the go</li><li><b>Useful resources</b> including a packing list, a phrase book of British slang, a historical overview, and recommended reading</li><li><b>Over 900 bible-thin pages</b> include everything worth seeing without weighing you down</li><li><b>Complete, up-to-date information</b> on London, Windsor and Cambridge, Canterbury, Dover, Brighton, Portsmouth, Dartmoor, Cornwall, Penzance, St. Ives, Penwith Peninsula, Bath, Glastonbury, Wells, Avebury, Stonehenge, Salisbury, Oxford, the Cotswolds, Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwick, Coventry, Ironbridge Gorge, Liverpool, Blackpool, the Lake District, Yorkshire, Durham, and more</li></ul><b>Make the most of every day and every dollar with <i>Rick Steves England.</i></b><br><br>Spending just a few days in the city?

The omission of her name from Shakespeare's will has been interpreted as evidence that she was nothing more than an unfortunate mistake from which Shakespeare did well to distance himself.</p><p>While Shakespeare is above all the poet of marriage&#x2014;repeatedly in his plays, constant wives redeem unjust and deluded husbands&#x2014;scholars persist in positing the worst about the writer's own spouse. In <em>Shakespeare's Wife</em>, Germaine Greer boldly breaks new ground, combining literary-historical techniques with documentary evidence about life in Stratford, to reset the story of Shakespeare's marriage in its social context. With deep insight and intelligence, she offers daring and thoughtful new theories about the farmer's daughter who married England's greatest poet, painting a vivid portrait of a remarkable woman.</p><p>A passionate and perceptive work of first-rate scholarship that reclaims this maligned figure from generations of scholarly neglect and misogyny, <em>Shakespeare's Wife</em> poses bold questions and opens new fields of investigation and research.</p></p><p><p>Germaine Greer is a writer, academic, and critic, and is widely regarded as one of the most significant feminist voices of our time. Her bestselling books include <em>The Female Eunuch</em> and <em>The Whole Woman</em>. She lives in northwest Essex, England, and has taught Shakespeare at universities in Australia, Britain, and the United States.</p><b>Chapter One</b> <br><br><i>Introducing the extensive and reputable family of Hathaway alias Gardner of Shottery together with the curious fact that one of their kinsmen was a successful playwright for the Admiral's Men <br></i><br>Shakespeare's wife was identified as long ago as 1709, when Nicholas Rowe informed the readers of his edition of the plays: 'His wife was the daughter of one Hathaway, said to have been a substantial yeoman in the neighbourhood of Stratford." There were many Hathaways within a day's ride of Stratford. Hathaways farmed in Bishopton and Shottery in Warwickshire, and in Horton, Bledington, Kingscote and surrounding districts in neighbouring Gloucestershire. There were also tradesmen called Hathaway in London, Banbury and Oxford, and one or two claimed the rank of gentleman. The Hathaway horde was so numerous in fact that the Shottery family into which Ann was born used a distinguishing alias. They were known mostly as Hathaway alias Gardner, and sometimes as just plain Hathaway or just plain Gardner. <br><br>In the medieval period such aliases served to distinguish between people with the same surname by specifying the region or town they came from or the trade they followed. Perhaps an earlier Hathaway had indeed been a gardener. Sometimes, when there was no male heir, a female descendant's husband might inherit on condition that he assumed her family name as an alias. The point of aliases is still being disputed by genealogists; although during Ann Shakespeare's lifetime the use of aliases became less consistent, it was a generation or two before it faded out altogether. We know that Ann's grandfather John Hathaway was already using the alias, so it is not something we are likely ever to unravel. For years nobody realised that the 'Jone Gardner of Shottery' who was buried in Holy Trinity churchyard in 1599 was the same person they had already identified as Ann Shakespeare's stepmother. In 1590 a 'Thomas Greene alias Shakespeare' was buried in Holy Trinity Church Stratford, sending historians off on a wild-goose chase for a woman called Greene giving birth to an illegitimate Shakespeare, or vice versa, for the alias was occasionally used for <i>de facto</i> wives and to denote descent on the wrong side of the blanket. <br><br>The Christian name of the woman who married William Shakespeare in 1582 is as unstable as her surname. The only evidence that Richard Hathaway alias Gardner of Shottery had a daughter called Ann is a reference in his will to a daughter called Agnes. Scholars have demonstrated convincingly that in this period Agnes and Ann were simply treated as versions of the same name, pointing out dozens of examples where Agnes, pronounced 'Annis', gradually becomes 'Ann'. Richard Hathaway left a sheep to a great-niece he calls Agnes, though according to the parish record she was actually christened Annys; in 1600 she was buried as Ann. Theatre manager Philip Henslowe called his wife Agnes in his will but she was buried as Ann. Ann's brother Bartholomew called a daughter Annys, but she was buried as Ann. The curate William Gilbert alias Higgs who wrote Hathaway's will married Agnes Lyncian, but she was buried as Ann Gilbert. This is not simply serendipitous. Agnes was the name of a fourth-century virgin martyr of the kind whose lurid and preposterous adventures are the stuff of <i>The Golden Legend</i>, justly ridiculed by protestant reformers. Ann (or Hannah) was the solid biblical name of the Redeemer's grandmother. It is only to be expected that as protestantism gained hearts and minds Agnes would be silently driven out by Ann. We may accept that the child born Agnes Hathaway grew up to be Ann Shakespeare. <br><br>The brass plate set in the stone over her grave next to William's in the chancel of Holy Trinity Church Stratford tells us that Ann Shakespeare 'departed this life on the sixth day of August 1623 being of the age of 67 years'. We have no evidence to corroborate this information. If the funeral plate is correct she was born in 1556, eight years before her husband. Engravers do make mistakes; the figures 1 and 7 are easily confounded in the calligraphy of 1623, but as all Ann's family was baptised at Holy Trinity, where the registers began to be kept in obedience to the royal edict of 1558, we must conclude that she was born before the register began to be kept, and not afterwards. So 1556 it is. <br><br>Our best evidence that Agnes Hathaway alias Gardner of Shottery is the woman who married Will Shakespeare in 1582 is the will made in 1601 by her father's shepherd Thomas Whittington. Whittington is identified in Richard Hathaway's will: 'I owe unto Thomas Whittington my shepherd four pounds six shillings eight pence.' Twenty years on, when he made his will in 1601, Whittington identified Ann as Shakespeare's wife: <br><br><i>Item I give and bequeath unto the poor people of Stratford forty shillings that is in the hand of Ann Shakespeare wife unto Mr William Shakespeare and is due debt unto me being paid to mine executor by the said William Shakespeare or his assigns according to the true meaning of this my will.</i><br><br>The Hathaway family house is supposed to be the one that is now known as Ann Hathaway's Cottage, though indeed it was never hers. This twelve-roomed farmhouse, known to the Hathaway family, if not to the bardolatrous public, as Hewlands Farm, is built on stone foundations, of timber-framed wattle-and-daub. The oldest part of the dwelling, thought to date from the late fourteenth century, consists of a hall of two twelve-foot bays reaching to the timbered roof, constructed around two oaken crucks that are pinned together to form the peak of the roof Before the Great Rebuilding of the 1560s, all the members of the household would have slept in the hall, around an open fireplace from which the smoke escaped through an opening in the thatch.<br><br>Ann's paternal grandfather, John Hathaway alias Gardner, acquired the copyhold of Hewlands Farm in 1543 and it was probably he who modernised the house by installing stone fireplaces in each of the two bays of the hall, one eight feet across and the other eleven. The stone hearths were also the supports for stout oak bressemers supporting an upper floor which was divided into separate connecting rooms. On the ground floor, next to the hall, there was a kitchen with a huge domed bread-oven. A dairy or buttery has also survived. An east wing was added to the main building later, probably by Ann's brother, Bartholomew Hathaway.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Esprit Quilt Collection, The</h2><p>...Gathered in the this space, and on permanent public display, is one of the world&#39;s greatest quilt collections.

Cringely's <i>Accidental Empires</i> and Michael A.

But Walter Isaacson goes them one better: <i>The Innovators</i>, his follow-up to the massive (in both sales and size) <i>Steve Jobs</i>, is probably the widest-ranging and most comprehensive narrative of them all. Don't let the scope or page-count deter you: while Isaacson builds the story from the 19th century--innovator by innovator, just as the players themselves stood atop the achievements of their predecessors--his discipline and era-based structure allows readers to dip in and out of digital history, from Charles Babbage's Difference Engine, to Alan Turing and the codebreakers of Bletchley Park, to Tim Berners-Lee and the birth of the World Wide Web (with contextual nods to influential counterculture weirdos along the way). Isaacson's presentation is both brisk and illuminating; while it doesn't supersede previous histories, <i>The Innovators</i> might be the definitive overview, and it's certainly one hell of a read. --<i>Jon Foro</i></p>Walter Isaacson, University Professor of History at Tulane, has been CEO of the Aspen Institute, chairman of CNN, and editor of Time magazine.

We deserve to know the dangers in advance -including the difficulties we may encounter when trying to withdraw. <i>Your Drug May Be Your Problem</i> is the only book to provide an up-to-date, uncensored description of the dangers involved in taking every kind of psychiatric medication, and it is the first and only book to explain how to coordinate a safe withdrawal from them.</p><p>Psychiatric drugs are prescribed to more than 20 million Americans. This book aims to convince us to stop taking these drugs, and to show us how to do it safely. The authors contend that after 15 minutes with a physician or psychiatrist, Americans are prescribed medications that we may take for years or a lifetime, which can do more harm than good. We're irritable, anxious, emotionally numbed, physically fatigued, and mentally dulled. Yet when we stop taking the drugs, we encounter a whole new set of problems and setbacks.<p> The book lists the adverse medical reactions you may encounter, plus additional personal, psychological, and philosophical reasons for limiting or rejecting psychiatric drugs. About half the book covers withdrawing from your drug--how to do it carefully and slowly, what to expect, and how to get help--with specifics for certain drugs and a chapter on easing your child off them as well.</p><p> If you suffer from depression or another condition that warrants taking prescription drugs, you might refute the authors' contention that "the degree to which we suffer indicates the degree to which we are alive. When we take drugs to ease our suffering, we stifle our psychological and spiritual life." Certainly it would be lovely if we could "find a way to untangle that twisted energy and to redirect it more creatively," but is this really possible in all cases? The authors blame our dependence on drugs and psychiatry on big pharmaceutical-company bucks, psychiatric organizations, and even government agencies. Certainly we are an overmedicated society--but is the answer to take everyone off drugs? This provocative book says yes, and it's bound to be controversial.</p><p> Of course, do not go off any prescribed medication without working closely with the medical professional who prescribed it, and do not use this book as a substitute for professional help. <i>--Joan Price</i></p><b>Peter R.

According to The Kneeling Christian, "All real growth in the spiritual life--all victory over temptation, all confidence and peace in the presence of difficulties and dangers, all repose of spirit in times of great disappointment or loss, all habitual communion with God--depends on the practice of secret prayer."This powerful, time-tested book points the way toward communion with God and all the life-changing benefits that derive from it.</p><p>Unknown Christian</p><h2>All My Friends Are Going to Be Strangers: A Novel</h2><p>On the verge of success as a published author, Danny Deck flees Houston and becomes involved with three separate women, including his fickle girlfriend, a lusty neighbor, and his pal, Emma Horton.

Butterfly chronicles the strange love affair between a French diplomat in Beijing and a mysterious opera singer, a liaison in which the Frenchman is unaware that his lover is a man. 30,000 first printing. $30,000 ad/promo.</p><p>High-class retelling of the real-life affair behind the mistaken-sex plot of M. Butterfly. Wadler wrote the poignant My Breast (1992). Bernard Boursicot sought adventure and, in the early 60's, wound up clerking for the French embassy in Beijing as a 20-year- old virgin who'd detached himself from some distasteful homosexual episodes as a schoolboy. In China, he met Shi Pei Pu, a small, mysterious, and apparently male singer who'd played women's roles with the Beijing Opera. After many months of shared lunches and dinners, Pei Pu revealed to Bernard that he was actually a woman. His anxiety-ridden parents had raised him as a boy, he said, and, in unisex Mao clothes, it had been easy to pass as a man. Slowly, Bernard fell for Pei Pu, then began having sex with her/him, usually in the dark but not always. According to both, this was passionate sex, and, 18 years later, Bernard still thought Pei Pu a woman despite the singer's affairs with other women. When the two were arrested in Paris for spying (Bernard had fallen under the spell of Mao's Little Red Book and performed some innocuous spying for China so he could stay with Pei Pu and care for his supposed son by the singer), doctors proved that Pei Pu was a man. How had the guileful Pei Pu duped Bernard for so long? Well, the answer convinces but won't be revealed here, since Wadler (who badgers Bernard in several interviews reprinted throughout the text) passes through several explanations before arriving, on her last page, at the real trick used by Pei Pu.... Compelling and faintly bittersweet. (Sixteen pages of b&amp;w photographs--not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>What better recipe for a nonfiction best seller than the combination of bizarre sex and espionage that makes this book irresistible? In 1964, Bernard Boursicot, a French embassy clerk in Peking, fell in love with Shi Pei Pu, an androgynous Peking Opera singer, who was actually a man pretending to be a woman disguised as a man! This Baroque story of deception casts Boursicot as a bisexual fool who dabbles in espionage; Shi Pei Pu as sexual magician who conjures up a Eurasian "son," the supposed fruit of their union; and a large number of assorted lovers, friends, and relatives. The basis for the hit Broadway play M. Butterfly , it may be read both as pure theater and as a study in sexual deconstruction. Unfortunately, Wadler is unduly obsessed with the purely prurient aspect of a story she tells very well, and her journalistic voyeurism finally verges on peep-show pornography.

She speaks lovingly of those who encouraged her over the years, including her sister Jon, London agent Spencer Curtis Brown, Viking publishing president Ben Huebsch (her "literary father"), and the late James Haynes-Dixon, with whom she enjoyed a sturdy second marriage.

Countless taboos are shattered when Elsha, an idealistic and rebellious Quelled girl, is chosen to be handmaid to the Firelord--the man revered by those calling themselves the Chosen. Traveling in the privileged class, Elsha encounters ugly, unthinking prejudice; she also meets a few relatively enlightened Chosen men, who cannot help falling in love with the feisty maid. Spurred on by a hatred of injustice, Elsha battles against sexism, improves life for the Quelled, and even (it seems) hastens the return of the sun to her world. Because there is never any real doubt that Elsha will inherit the Firelord's mantle, there are moments--especially as the harsh spectacle of life in the mines recedes--when her various victories grow a bit predictable. But this is a minor quibble; taken as a whole, the stalwart heroine's visionary struggles are nothing short of inspiring. With a spare and effective style, Jordan brings Elsha's chilly world into sharp focus with a minimum of description. Elsha's exploits will appeal to fans of Robin McKinley's The Blue Sword and The Hero and the Crown. Ages 12-up. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.From Jordan (A Time of Darkness, 1990), another tale set in an ecologically devastated future. Living in treeless mountains under cold perpetual clouds, human society has split into two classes: the autocratic Chosen and the despised Quelled, who mine the coal that's the only available source of heat. To general consternation, the ruling Firelord has picked Elsha, an angry Quelled teenager, as his new and only Handmaid; she vows to better the lot of her people, though it means battling centuries of prejudice. Though the scenario here is promising, Jordan focuses on Elsha's thoughts and smoldering spirit to the exclusion of believable plot development, background detail, and even character (Chosen and Quelled alike seem sketchy and unrealized). Meanwhile, Elsha sounds like a walking essay (``Your treatment of us is wrong, evil and unendurable,'' etc.); when she becomes Firelord after a perfunctory, awkwardly inserted battle, her decrees meet no determined resistance from Chosen who've previously responded to her with violent hatred. The emotion is affecting here, but relationships are confused rather than complex; loose ends dangle from the long, predictable story, and Elsha is unchanged by her experiences. (Fiction.

William heard the speculations from a group of idlers on the quay nearby, wondering whether it would be seen again.<br><br>&#x201c;Na, him be gone for good,&#x201d; said a ragged man of mixed blood, shaking his head. &#x201c;De ally-gator don&#x2019; take him, de water will.&#x201d;<br><br>A backwoodsman shifted his tobacco and spat into the water in disagreement.<br><br>&#x201c;No, he&#x2019;s good for another day&#x2014;two, maybe. Them gristly bits what holds the head on, they dry out in the sun. Tighten up like iron. Seen it many a time with deer carcasses.&#x201d;<br><br>William saw Mrs. MacKenzie glance quickly at the harbor, then away. She looked pale, he thought, and maneuvered himself slightly so as to block her view of the men and the brown flood of high tide, though since it was high, the corpse tied to its stake was naturally not visible. The stake was, though&#x2014;a stark reminder of the price of crime. The pirate had been staked to drown on the mudflats several days before, the persistence of his decaying corpse an ongoing topic of public conversation.<br><br>&#x201c;Jem!&#x201d; Mr. MacKenzie called sharply, and lunged past William in pursuit of his son. The little boy, red-haired like his mother, had wandered away to listen to the men&#x2019;s talk, and was now leaning perilously out over the water, clinging to a bollard in an attempt to see the dead pirate.<br><br>Mr. MacKenzie snatched the boy by the collar, pulled him in, and swept him up in his arms, though the boy struggled, craning back toward the swampish harbor.<br><br>&#x201c;I want to see the wallygator eat the pirate, Daddy!&#x201d;<br><br>The idlers laughed, and even MacKenzie smiled a little, though the smile disappeared when he glanced at his wife. He was at her side in an instant, one hand beneath her elbow.<br><br>&#x201c;I think we must be going,&#x201d; MacKenzie said, shifting his son&#x2019;s weight in order better to support his wife, whose distress was apparent. &#x201c;Lieutenant Ransom&#x2014;Lord Ellesmere, I mean&#x201d;&#x2014;he corrected with an apologetic smile at William&#x2014;&#x201c;will have other engagements, I&#x2019;m sure.&#x201d;<br><br>This was true; William was engaged to meet his father for supper. Still, his father had arranged to meet him at the tavern just across the quay; there was no risk of missing him. William said as much, and urged them to stay, for he was enjoying their company&#x2014;Mrs. MacKenzie&#x2019;s, particularly&#x2014;but she smiled regretfully, though her color was better, and patted the capped head of the baby in her arms.<br><br>&#x201c;No, we do have to be going.&#x201d; She glanced at her son, still struggling to get down, and William saw her eyes flicker toward the harbor and the stark pole that stood above the flood. She resolutely looked away, fixing her eyes upon William&#x2019;s face instead. &#x201c;The baby&#x2019;s waking up; she&#x2019;ll be wanting food. It was so lovely to meet you, though. I wish we might talk longer.&#x201d; She said this with the greatest sincerity, and touched his arm lightly, giving him a pleasant sensation in the pit of the stomach.<br><br>The idlers were now placing wagers on the reappearance of the drowned pirate, though by the looks of things, none of them had two groats to rub together.<br><br>&#x201c;Two to one he&#x2019;s still there when the tide goes out.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Five to one the body&#x2019;s still there, but the head&#x2019;s gone. I don&#x2019;t care what you say about the gristly bits, Lem, that there head was just a-hangin&#x2019; by a thread when this last tide come in. Next un&#x2019;ll take it, sure.&#x201d;<br><br>Hoping to drown this conversation out, William embarked on an elaborate farewell, going so far as to kiss Mrs. MacKenzie&#x2019;s hand with his best court manner&#x2014;and, seized by inspiration, kissed the baby girl&#x2019;s hand, too, making them all laugh. Mr. MacKenzie gave him rather an odd look, but didn&#x2019;t seem offended, and shook his hand in a most republican manner&#x2014;playing out the joke by setting down his son and making the little boy shake hands as well.<br><br>&#x201c;Have you kilt anybody?&#x201d; the boy inquired with interest, looking at William&#x2019;s dress sword.<br><br>&#x201c;No, not yet,&#x201d; William replied, smiling.<br><br>&#x201c;My grandsire&#x2019;s kilt two dozen men!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Jemmy!&#x201d; Both parents spoke at once, and the little boy&#x2019;s shoulders went up around his ears.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, he has!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure he is a bold and bloody man, your grandsire,&#x201d; William assured the little boy gravely. &#x201c;The King always has need of such men.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My grandda says the King can kiss his arse,&#x201d; the boy replied matter- of-factly.<br><br>&#x201c;JEMMY!&#x201d;<br><br>Mr. MacKenzie clapped a hand over his outspoken offspring&#x2019;s mouth.<br><br>&#x201c;You know your grandda didn&#x2019;t say that!&#x201d; Mrs. MacKenzie said. The little boy nodded agreeably, and his father removed the muffling hand.<br><br>&#x201c;No. Grannie did, though.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s somewhat more likely,&#x201d; Mr. MacKenzie murmured, obviously trying not to laugh. &#x201c;But we still don&#x2019;t say things like that to soldiers&#x2014;they work for the King.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; said Jemmy, clearly losing interest. &#x201c;Is the tide going out now?&#x201d; he asked hopefully, craning his neck toward the harbor once more.<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Mr. MacKenzie said firmly. &#x201c;Not for hours. You&#x2019;ll be in bed.&#x201d;<br><br>Mrs. MacKenzie smiled at William in apology, her cheeks charmingly flushed with embarrassment, and the family took its leave with some haste, leaving William struggling between laughter and dismay.<br><br>&#x201c;Oy, Ransom!&#x201d;<br><br>He turned at his name, to find Harry Dobson and Colin Osborn, two second lieutenants from his regiment, evidently escaped from duty and eager to sample the fleshpots of Wilmington&#x2014;such as they were.<br><br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; Dobson looked after the departing group, interested.<br><br>&#x201c;A Mr. and Mrs. MacKenzie. Friends of my father&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, married, is she?&#x201d; Dobson sucked in his cheeks, still watching the woman. &#x201c;Well, make it a bit harder, I suppose, but what&#x2019;s life without a challenge?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Challenge?&#x201d; William gave his diminutive friend a jaundiced look. &#x201c;Her husband&#x2019;s roughly three times your size, if you hadn&#x2019;t noticed.&#x201d;<br><br>Osborn laughed, going red in the face.<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s twice his size! She&#x2019;d crush you, Dobby.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And what makes you think I mean to be on the bottom?&#x201d; Dobson inquired with dignity. Osborn hooted.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s this obsession of yours with giantesses?&#x201d; William demanded. He glanced at the little family, now nearly out of sight at the end of the street. &#x201c;That woman&#x2019;s nearly as tall as I am!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, rub it in, why don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; Osborn, who was taller than Dobson&#x2019;s five feet, but still a head shorter than William, aimed a mock kick at his knee. William dodged it and cuffed Osborn, who ducked and shoved him into Dobson.<br><br>&#x201c;Gennelmen!&#x201d; The menacing cockney tones of Sergeant Cutter brought them up sharp. They might outrank the sergeant, but not one of them would have the nerve to point this out. The entire battalion went in fear of Sergeant Cutter, who was older than God and approximately Dobson&#x2019;s height, but who contained within his diminutive physique the sheer fury of a full-sized volcano on the boil.<br><br>&#x201c;Sergeant!&#x201d; Lieutenant William Ransom, Earl of Ellesmere and senior of the group, drew himself up straight, chin pressed back into his stock. Osborn and Dobson hastily followed his lead, quaking in their boots.<br><br>Cutter strode back and forth in front of them, in the manner of a stalking leopard. You could just see the lashing tail and the preliminary licking of chops, William thought. Waiting for the bite was almost worse than getting it in the arse.<br><br>&#x201c;And where&#x2019;s your troops, then?&#x201d; Cutter snarled. &#x201c;Sirs?&#x201d;<br><br>Osborn and Dobson at once began sputtering explanations, but Lieutenant Ransom&#x2014;for once&#x2014;walked on the side of the angels.<br><br>&#x201c;My men are guarding the Governor&#x2019;s Palace, under Lieutenant Colson. I&#x2019;m given leave, Sergeant, to dine with my father,&#x201d; he said respectfully. &#x201c;By Sir Peter.&#x201d;<br><br>Sir Peter Packer&#x2019;s was a name to conjure with, and Cutter abated in mid-spew. Rather to William&#x2019;s surprise, though, it wasn&#x2019;t Sir Peter&#x2019;s name that had produced this reaction.<br><br>&#x201c;Your father?&#x201d; Cutter said, squinting. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s Lord John Grey, is it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Er . . . yes,&#x201d; William replied cautiously. &#x201c;Do you . . . know him?&#x201d;<br><br>Before Cutter could reply, the door of a nearby tavern opened, and William&#x2019;s father came out. William smiled in delight at this timely appearance, but quickly erased the smile as the sergeant&#x2019;s gimlet gaze fixed on him.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you be a-grinnin&#x2019; at me like an &#x2019;airy hape,&#x201d; the sergeant began, in dangerous tones, but was interrupted by Lord John&#x2019;s clapping him familiarly on the shoulder&#x2014;something none of the three young lieutenants would have done if offered significant money.<br><br>&#x201c;Cutter!&#x201d; Lord John said, smiling warmly. &#x201c;I heard those dulcet tones and said to myself, why damn me if it isn&#x2019;t Sergeant Aloysius Cutter! There can&#x2019;t be another man alive who sounds so much like a bulldog that&#x2019;s swallowed a cat and lived to tell about it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Aloysius?&#x201d; Dobson mouthed at William, but William merely grunted briefly in response, unable to shrug, as his father had now turned his attention in his direction.<br><br>&#x201c;William,&#x201d; he said, with a cordial nod. &#x201c;How very punctual you are. My apologies for being so late; I was detained.&#x201d; Before William could say anything or introduce the others, though, Lord John had embarked upon a lengthy reminiscence with Sergeant Cutter, reliving high old times on the Plains of Abraham with General Wolfe.<br><br>This allowed the three young officers to relax slightly, which, in Dobson&#x2019;s case, meant a return to his earlier train of thought.<br><br>&#x201c;You said that red-haired poppet&#x2019;s a friend of your father&#x2019;s?&#x201d; he whispered to William. &#x201c;Find out from him where she&#x2019;s staying, eh?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Idiot,&#x201d; hissed Osborn. &#x201c;She isn&#x2019;t even pretty! She&#x2019;s long-nosed as&#x2014;as &#x2014;as Willie!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t see as high as her face,&#x201d; Dobson said, smirking. &#x201c;Her tits were right at eye-level, though, and those . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ass!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Shh!&#x201d; Osborn stamped on Dobson&#x2019;s foot to shut him up as Lord John turned back to the young men.<br><br>&#x201c;Will you introduce me to your friends, William?&#x201d; Lord John inquired politely. Rather red in the face&#x2014;he had reason to know that his father had acute hearing, despite his artillery experiences&#x2014;William did so, and Osborn and Dobson both bowed, looking rather awed. They hadn&#x2019;t realized who his father was, and William was at once proud that they were impressed, and mildly dismayed that they&#x2019;d discovered Lord John&#x2019;s identity&#x2014;it would be all over the battalion before supper tomorrow. Not that Sir Peter didn&#x2019;t know, of course, but&#x2014;<br><br>He gathered his wits, realizing that his father was taking leave for them both, and returned Sergeant Cutter&#x2019;s salute, hastily but in good form, before hurrying after his father, leaving Dobby and Osborn to their fate.<br><br>&#x201c;I saw you speaking to Mr. and Mrs. MacKenzie,&#x201d; Lord John said casually. &#x201c;I trust they are well?&#x201d; He glanced down the quay, but the MacKenzies had long since disappeared from view.<br><br>&#x201c;Seemed so,&#x201d; Willie said. He was not going to ask where they stayed, but the impression the young woman had made on him lingered. He couldn&#x2019;t say if she was pretty or not; her eyes had struck him, though &#x2014;a wonderful deep blue with long auburn lashes, and fixed on him with a flattering intensity that had warmed the cockles of his heart. Grotesquely tall, of course, but&#x2014;what was he thinking? The woman was married&#x2014;with children! And red-haired, to boot.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve&#x2014;er&#x2014;known them long?&#x201d; he asked, thinking of the startlingly perverse political sentiments that evidently flourished in the family.<br><br>&#x201c;Quite some time. She is the daughter of one of my oldest friends, Mr. James Fraser. Do you recall him, by chance?&#x201d;<br><br>William frowned, not placing the name&#x2014;his father had thousands of friends, how should he . . .<br><br>&#x201c;Oh!&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Not an English friend, you don&#x2019;t mean. Was it not a Mr. Fraser that we visited in the mountains, that time when you fell sick of the&#x2014;of the measle?&#x201d; The bottom of his stomach dropped a little, remembering the sheer terror of that time. He had traveled through the mountains in a daze of misery; his mother had died only a month before. Then Lord John had caught the measle, and William had been sure that his father was about to die likewise, leaving him completely alone in the wilderness. There hadn&#x2019;t been room for anything in his mind but fear and grief, and he retained only a jumble of confused impressions from the visit. He had some dim recollection that Mr. Fraser had taken him fishing and been kind to him.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; his father said, with a sidelong smile. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m touched, Willie. I should have thought you might recall that visit more because of your own misadventure than mine.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mis&#x2014;&#x201d; Memory rushed over him, succeeded by a flood of heat, hotter than the humid summer air. &#x201c;Thanks very much! I&#x2019;d managed to expunge that from my memory, until you mentioned it!&#x201d;<br><br>His father was laughing, and making no attempt to hide it. In fact, he was convulsed.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Willie,&#x201d; he said, gasping and wiping his eyes with a corner of his handkerchief. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t help it; it was the most&#x2014;the most &#x2014;oh, God, I&#x2019;ll never forget what you looked like when we pulled you out of that privy!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You know it was an accident,&#x201d; William said stiffly. His cheeks burned with remembered mortification. At least Fraser&#x2019;s daughter hadn&#x2019;t been present to witness his humiliation at the time.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, of course. But&#x2014;&#x201d; His father pressed the handkerchief to his mouth, his shoulders shaking silently.<br><br>&#x201c;Feel free to stop cackling at any point,&#x201d; William said coldly. &#x201c;Where the devil are we going, anyway?&#x201d; They&#x2019;d reached the end of the quay, and his father was leading them&#x2014;still snorting like a grampus&#x2014; into one of the quiet, tree-lined streets, away from the taverns and inns near the harbor.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re dining with a Captain Richardson,&#x201d; his father said, controlling himself with an obvious effort. He coughed, blew his nose, and put away the handkerchief. &#x201c;At the house of a Mr. Bell.&#x201d;<br><br>Mr. Bell&#x2019;s house was whitewashed, neat, and prosperous, without being ostentatious. Captain Richardson gave much the same sort of impression: of middle age, well-groomed and well-tailored, but without any notable style, and with a face you couldn&#x2019;t pick out of a crowd two minutes after seeing it.<br><br>The two Misses Bell made a much stronger impression, particularly the younger, Miriam, who had honey-colored curls peeping out of her cap, and big, round eyes that remained fixed on William throughout dinner. She was seated too far away for him to be able to converse with her directly, but he fancied that the language of the eyes was sufficient to indicate to her that the fascination was mutual, and if an opportunity for more personal communication should offer later . . . ? A smile, and a demure lowering of honey-colored lashes, followed by a quick glance toward a door that stood open to the side porch, for air. He smiled back.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you think so, William?&#x201d; his father said, loudly enough to indicate that it was the second time of asking.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, certainly. Um . . . think what?&#x201d; he asked, since it was after all Papa, and not his commander. His father gave him the look that meant he would have rolled his eyes had they not been in public, but replied patiently.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Piece and Quilt with Precuts: 11 Quilts, 18 Machine-Quilting Designs, Start-to-Finish Success!</h2><p><p>Learn easy, efficient tricks for piecing irresistible quilt tops with precuts and leftover fabric scraps, and discover 18 machine-quilting motifs you can mix and match.

Sutter's vivid narrative takes us back to a time when American technology was cutting-edge and jet travel was still glamorous and new. With wit and warmth, he gives an insider's sense of the larger than life-size personalities&#x2014;and the tensions&#x2014;in the aeronautical world.</p></p><p><p>Joe Sutter led the team of engineers that created the Boeing 747. He served on the Presidential Commission to investigate the Challenger explosion with Neil Armstrong, Sally Ride, and Richard Feynman. Now in his eighties, he still serves as a consultant to Boeing. He lives in Seattle.</p><br><br><p>Jay Spenser has spent a lifetime studying aviation as a museum curator at the National Air and Space Museum and the Museum of Flight, and as an aerospace industry writer. He is the co-author of <em>747</em> and lives in Seattle, Washington.</p>As leader of the Boeing company's design and engineering team that created the 747&#x2014;the world's first wide-body, twin-aisle airplane&#x2014;Sutter had perhaps the best overall view of all aspects of the 747's development in the mid 1960s. This engaging look at the technical, political and corporate forces that clashed over the 747 adds important details to Clive Irving's 1993 <i>Wide-Body: The Triumph of the 747</i>. Sutter's descriptions of the furious pace his team had to maintain proves his assertion that the 747's development process closely resembled that of aviation's colorful early days. It is fascinating to read that while the 747 later became Boeing's crowning achievement, with variations of the plane continuing to remain popular during the past three decades, various Boeing executives during the '60s "were taken in by the enticing vision" of supersonic transports like the Concorde, and Sutter had to fight "every step of the way to get the 747 designed, built, certified, and into service." 8-page b&amp;w photo insert, 20 b&amp;w photos throughout, not seen by <i>PW</i>. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But what if we flipped the paradigm? What if we thought about dental health as the foundation for our physical health as a whole?Dr. Steven Lin, an experienced dentist and the world&#x2019;s first dental nutritionist, has analyzed our ancestral traditions, epigenetics, gut health, and the microbiome in order to develop food-based principles for a literal top-down holistic health approach. Merging dental and nutritional science, Dr. Lin lays out the dietary program that can help ensure you won&#x2019;t need dental fillings or cholesterol medications&#x2014;and give you the resources to raise kids who develop naturally straight teeth. With our mouth as the gatekeeper of our gut, keeping our oral microbiome balanced will create a healthy body through a healthy mouth.Dr. Lin arms you with a 40-day meal plan, complete with the Dental Diet food pyramid, exercises for the mouth, recipes, and cooking techniques to help you easily and successfully implement his techniques into your everyday life. The tools to improve overall wellness levels and reverse disease are closer than we think&#x2014;in our markets, in our pantries, and, most frequently, in our mouths&#x2014;if not just a well-chosen bite or two away.</p><p>Dr. Steven Lin is a board-accredited dentist, speaker, and author. Frustrated by the dental profession&#x2019;s limited approach to applying without addressing the cause of disease, Dr. Lin merged anthropological, physiological, and nutritional science with oral health to integrate effective prevention strategies into his dental practice. A passionate health educator, Dr. Lin engages in a wide variety of community and institutional programs to grow awareness of preventative lifestyles. He is the dental expert for I Quit Sugar, the online platform of best-selling author Sarah Wilson. Dr. Lin is based out of Sydney, Australia, and you can visit him online at www.drstevenlin.com."I love that Dr Steven Lin is getting us to focus on the microbiome of the mouth, and eating a diet to balance this bacteria as well as the microbes further down the digestive tract, so that we have good dental health for the long run. He also shines the spotlight on why we need animal fats in our diet so that we absorb the vitamins and minerals from our vegetables for strong teeth and good health, a fact which is getting forgotten in the current excitement about plant-based diets. Dr Lin explains the science really well AND gives lots of practical tips on how to implement a dental diet based on new science easily and deliciously."Jeannette Hyde&nbsp;Author of The Gut Makeover and Registered Nutritional Therapist BSc (Hons) CNHC mBANT</p><h2>50 Essays: A Portable Anthology - Third Edition (Hardcover)</h2><p>This hardback book &#34;50 Essays&#34; is preowned and is in very good condition.

With <b>Midwives</b>, he explored the literal and metaphoric place of birth in our culture. In <b>The Buffalo Soldier</b>, he introduced us to one of contemporary literature&#x2019;s most beloved foster children. And in <b>Before You Know Kindness</b>, he plumbed animal rights, gun control, and what it means to be a parent.<br><br>Chris Bohjalian&#x2019;s riveting fiction keeps us awake deep into the night. As <i>The New York Times</i> has said, &#x201c;Few writers can manipulate a plot with Bohjalian&#x2019;s grace and power.&#x201d; Now he is back with an ambitious new novel that travels between Jay Gatsby&#x2019;s Long Island and rural New England, between the Roaring Twenties and the twenty-first century.<br><br>When college sophomore Laurel Estabrook is attacked while riding her bicycle through Vermont&#x2019;s back roads, her life is forever changed. Formerly outgoing, Laurel withdraws into her photography and begins to work at a homeless shelter. There she meets Bobbie Crocker, a man with a history of mental illness and a box of photographs that he won&#x2019;t let anyone see. When Bobbie dies suddenly, Laurel discovers that he was telling the truth: before he was homeless, Bobbie Crocker was a successful photographer who had indeed worked with such legends as Chuck Berry, Robert Frost, and Eartha Kitt.<br><br>As Laurel&#x2019;s fascination with Bobbie&#x2019;s former life begins to merge into obsession, she becomes convinced that some of his photographs reveal a deeply hidden, dark family secret. Her search for the truth will lead her further from her old life&#x2014;and into a cat-and-mouse game with pursuers who claim they want to save her.<br><br>In this spellbinding literary thriller, rich with complex and compelling characters&#x2014;including Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan&#x2014;Chris Bohjalian takes readers on his most intriguing, most haunting, and most unforgettable journey yet.</p><p>Best known for the provocative and powerful novel, <i>Midwives</i> (an Oprah Book Club� Selection), Chris Bohjalian writes beautiful and riveting fiction featuring what the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> dubbed "ordinary people in heartbreaking circumstances behaving with grace and dignity." In his new novel, <i>The Double Bind</i>, a literary thriller with references to (and including characters from) <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, Bohjalian takes readers on a haunting journey through one woman's obsession with uncovering a dark secret. We think Bohjalian fans will be thrilled with this compelling and unforgettable read, but just to be sure, we asked bestselling author Jodi Picoult to read <i>The Double Bind</i> and give us her take. Check out her review below. <i>--Daphne Durham</i><br><p> </p><strong>Guest Reviewer: Jodi Picoult</strong><br><br><b> From the provocative and gut-wrenching <i>The Pact</i>, to the brilliant genre-bending <i>The Tenth Circle</i>, to her latest novel about a high school shooting <i>Nineteen Minutes</i>, Jodi Picoult's riveting novels center on family and relationships, and bring to light questions and issues that remain with a reader long after the last page is turned.</b> <br><br> I once heard a fellow novelist call writing "successful schizophrenia"--we invent people and worlds that don't exist; but instead of being medicated, we are paid for it. Although countless novels succeed in whisking the reader away on the heels of such fabrications, there are very few that pull the curtain away from the craft, allowing us inside the mind of a working novelist as he combines reality and fantasy. Chris Bohjalian's <i>The Double Bind</i> is not just one of these; it's the finest example I've ever read of a book that tips its hat to both the beauty of the literary creation, as well as the magical act of creating.<p> Fact and fiction become indistinguishable in <i>The Double Bind</i>: The story centers on Laurel Estabrook, a young social worker and survivor of a near-rape, who stumbles across photographs taken by a formerly homeless client and tries to understand how a man who'd taken snapshots of celebrities in the 50s and 60s might have wound up on the streets. However, an author's note tells us that Bohjalian conceived this book after being shown a batch of old photographs taken by a once-homeless man; and the actual photos of Bob "Soupy" Campbell are peppered throughout the text. In another neat twist, Bohjalian's resurrects details from <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, which become "real" in the context of his own novel--Laurel lives in West Egg; part of her hunt for her photographer's past involves meeting with the descendants of Daisy and Tom Buchanan.</p><p> As a writer who counts <i>The Great Gatsby</i> as one of the books that changed her life, this inclusion was both startling and remarkable for me. Who doesn't want one's favorite characters to come to life--even if it's only within the constraints of another fictional work? But Bohjalian chose his text wisely: no discussion of <i>The Great Gatsby</i> is complete without alluding to missed opportunities and unreliable sources--critical elements in Laurel's quest. And therein lies Bohjalian's true double bind: all stories--even the ones we tell ourselves--are subject to our own interpretation, and to the degree we can make others believe them.</p><p> <i>The Double Bind</i> may flirt with the classics, but it's not your father's stuffy old tome: it's the sort of book you want to read in one sitting, and it packs a twist at the end that will leave you speechless. It also, worthily, spotlights the cause of homelessness in a way that isn't preachy, but honest and explanatory. Ultimately, what Bohjalian's done is offer his lucky readers another reminder of why he's such an extraordinary author: by creating characters that become so real we lose the distinction between truth and embellishment; by reminding us that the story of any life--whether fictional, functional, or marginal--is one to be savored. <i>--Jodi Picoult</i><br> </p><br>CHRIS BOHJALIAN is the critically acclaimed author of ten novels, including Midwives (a Publishers Weekly Best Book and an Oprah&#x2019;s Book Club selection) and his most recent New York Times bestseller, Before You Know Kindness.

She lives in Westport, Connecticut.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>Madame Karitska, leaving the shabby brownstone on Eighth Street, gave only a cursory glance at the sign in the first-floor window that read madame karitska, readings. It was ironic, she thought as she stepped into the bright noon sunshine, how a talent that had earned her whippings as a child, and for which she had never before accepted money, had led her so firmly to this street a year ago, and to this brownstone, to place the sign in the window that at last admitted her gift of clairvoyance.<br><br>On the other hand, her life had always been filled with surprises, and among them, here in Trafton, was her blossoming friendship with Detective Lieutenant Pruden, whose suspicions and skepticism had long since been obliterated by the help she&#x2019;d been able to offer him in his work. The shoddiness of the neighborhood neither bothered nor depressed her; after all, she had known poverty in Kabul, and wealth in Antwerp, and poverty again in America, and in spite of Eighth Street&#x2019;s flirting with decay it no longer seemed to deter her clients, which amused her. She was becoming known.<br><br>At the moment, however, she was between appointments and free to venture uptown for a few purchases, and she was in no hurry; she walked slowly, drinking in the sounds and colors along the way as if they were intoxicating, as for her they were. Reaching Tenth Street she saw that the warmth of the sun had brought Sreja Zagredi out of his secondhand furniture store to sit in the sun, and she greeted him cordially.<br><br>His eyes brightened. &#x201c;Ah, Madame Karitska, you have the step of a young girl!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And you the heart of a brigand,&#x201d; she told him. &#x201c;How is my rug today?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Still here,&#x201d; he told her, pointing to it displayed in the window. &#x201c;I have a very good offer for it the other day, from a man uptown who appreciates the finest of old rugs, I assure you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nonsense,&#x201d; said Madame Karitska crisply, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s a poor copy of an Oriental rug, and shabby as well.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Shabby! A good rug ages like wine,&#x201d; he told her indignantly. &#x201c;You want garish colors, God forbid? A hundred dollars is still my price, but only for you.&#x201d;<br><br>Madame Karitska smiled. &#x201c;The colors were garish,&#x201d; she pointed out amiably, &#x201c;but you&#x2019;ve had it hanging in the sun all winter, spring and summer to fade it. My offer remains eighty-five dollars.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Eighty-five!&#x201d; He pulled at his considerable hair in anguish. &#x201c;What a fool you make of me to tell this stranger from uptown I save it for a friend! With five children to feed you speak starvation to me, Madame Karitska.&#x201d;<br><br>She observed him critically. &#x201c;Scarcely starving. I think you could lose at least twenty pounds, Mr. Zagredi, if you cut down on the br�nz?a and the raki.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This is a rug worth at least one hundred fifty uptown!&#x201d;<br><br>Madame Karitska shrugged. &#x201c;Then take it uptown, Mr. Zagredi.&#x201d;<br><br>He blew through his mustache and eyed her shrewdly. &#x201c;For you I have already come down to one hundred.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And for you I have already gone up to eighty-five,&#x201d; she reminded him.<br><br>They eyed each other appreciatively, and he laughed. &#x201c;There is no one like you anymore, Madame Karitska; you know how to haggle like in the old country and it does my heart good. Like the knife&#x2014;sharp!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Very sharp, yes,&#x201d; she told him cheerfully. &#x201c;In the meantime it is good to see you, and say hello to your wife for me, Mr. Zagredi.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Come for a dinner of m?am?alig?a,&#x201d; he called after her. &#x201c;Come soon&#x2014;you are the only one who can put sense into my son&#x2019;s head about school.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I will,&#x201d; she promised, smiling, and they parted with perfect understanding, their minds pleasantly exercised and soothed by the exchange.<br><br>Reaching the subway station at Eleventh Street she paid her fare and was pleased to find a seat available. In the moment before the doors slammed shut, two men entered the car, one of them young, with a hard, suntanned face that almost matched the color of his trench coat, and who took a seat some distance away. The other, older man wore a dark, somewhat shabby suit and carried a small attach� case, and he sat down opposite her; glancing at him she gave a start, for she recognized him. Leaning forward she was about to call across the aisle to him when he lifted his head and looked directly at her and then through her, with not a trace of expression on his face.<br><br>At once Madame Karitska covered her movement by leaning down and retying a shoelace. When she straightened again she studied the man briefly and glanced away, but she was alert now, and thoughtful.<br><br>The train stopped at the next station and the man opposite her half rose, as if to leave, and then sank back. When he did this Madame Karitska noticed that farther down the car the man in the trench coat also made a move to leave and then aborted it. Seeing this she returned her glance to the impassive face across the aisle, and this time he met her gaze, and without expression they gazed at each other for a long moment.<br><br>At Fifteenth Street her friend in the shabby suit stood up, carrying his attach� case, and walked to the door to stand beside it as the train swayed to a halt. He was followed by the young man in the trench coat, but Madame Karitska saw him adroitly step aside to allow a woman to precede him, which placed him next to the younger man instead of in front of him. The doors slid open; the man with the attach� case walked out, hesitated and then stopped, allowing others to swarm past him.<br><br>Just as the doors began to close behind him he turned, looked back at Madame Karitska, and lifting his arm he threw his attach� case to her; she caught it in her lap just as the doors slammed shut. The last she saw of its owner he was hurrying toward the stairs to the street while the man in the trench coat stared back into the car, mouth slightly open, his eyes fixed on Madame Karitska. As the train picked up speed he turned and ran after the older man.<br><br>No one in the subway car appeared startled that Madame Karitska had been tossed a small attach� case by an apparent stranger. At the next station she left the train, and once above ground she signaled a cruising taxi: this was one time, she felt, when it was expedient not to be walking the streets, for unless Georges Verlag had changed his occupation since she had known him in Europe, he had just tossed her an attach� case filled with diamonds.<br><br>Ten minutes later she regained her apartment and drew a sigh of relief. Placing the attach� case on her square coffee table she examined its several locks and nodded, reasonably sure now that Georges was still a diamond salesman, and that the case contained a delivery of jewels worth a hundred thousand dollars, if not more. Georges had always been one of the best, as well as a good friend of her late husband, who had been a diamond merchant, and they had frequently entertained Georges in their Antwerp home. It had been a long time ago, but since she herself was now in America was it really so surprising that Georges, too, was here?<br><br>She thought a moment and then went to the phone and dialed police headquarters, asking for Lieutenant Pruden.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s out,&#x201d; said the desk sergeant. &#x201c;Is this Madame Karitska?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah, Margolies,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;what a good ear you have for voices. Yes, would you ask him to call me, please, when he returns? It&#x2019;s quite important.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Righto,&#x201d; said Margolies. &#x201c;Your ESP working again? He&#x2019;s out on a hit-and-run case, but&#x2014; Hold on, he&#x2019;s just walked in.&#x201d;<br><br>A second later Pruden was greeting her warmly.<br><br>&#x201c;Something has happened,&#x201d; she said calmly, &#x201c;so that I wonder if you could stop in here today at your convenience. I would have gone directly to the precinct if I could have been sure you were in, but&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That bad?&#x201d; he said lightly. &#x201c;Actually I can come right now, I&#x2019;m leaving in a minute and will be passing your street. Serious?&#x201d; he added in a lower voice.<br><br>&#x201c;Not precisely a criminal matter&#x2014;not yet,&#x201d; she explained.<br><br>&#x201c;Be there in five minutes,&#x201d; he said, and hung up.<br><br>In precisely five minutes a police car drew up to her building and Pruden was at her door. Entering her apartment he gave a quick glance around the room and then a look at her face as she brought out the tray of Turkish coffee and placed it on the table. &#x201c;Thank you for stopping, this won&#x2019;t take long,&#x201d; she told him.<br><br>His level brows lifted over his slate gray eyes. &#x201c;I thought at the very least you were being held captive here. Margolies said it was important?&#x201d;<br><br>She nodded. &#x201c;I think so,&#x201d; and pouring out the lavalike brew she handed him a cup and began describing to him her experience on the subway train. &#x201c;You see,&#x201d; she explained, &#x201c;when Georges first moved to go&#x2014;and then didn&#x2019;t&#x2014;he was very definitely showing me that he was being followed. When he did leave at the next stop&#x201d;&#x2014;from beneath the table she drew out the attach case and handed it to Pruden&#x2014;&#x201c;he threw this to me just as the doors closed behind him.&#x201d;<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Ms. Frizzle&#39;s Adventures: Medieval Castle</h2><p>In the second of MS.

Baker Athletics Complex, the university&#x2019;s sporting fields at the northern tip of Manhattan, seemed to have a set of carefree warriors on its grounds.<br> <br>A man who maintains the property never thought they would arrive. Maybe he was new, because I asked where the archery team would practice and he looked at me quizzically. He didn&#x2019;t believe that archery was a real Columbia team sport. It was understandable. I had arrived early and the targets were not yet up. Releasing arrows at up to 150 miles per hour aimed at targets seventy-five yards away means safety issues for all around, so the archery team doesn&#x2019;t practice next to any other. Mastery of this high-precision sport stays largely out of sight.<br> <br>Coach Derek Davis drove up with the archers and greeted me with his elbow leaning against the gray van&#x2019;s driver&#x2019;s side window. His silvery-white dreadlocks hung past his shoulders, covered under a blue patterned bandana that matched his Columbia University archery sweatshirt. He struck me as a composite fit to match this clan: gregarious and at ease, yet focused. On the phone a few days earlier, he had told me that he first picked up the sport as a casual hobby at his wife&#x2019;s insistence in the late 1980s (&#x201c;It was safer than pool and didn&#x2019;t involve alcohol&#x201d;). He has led the varsity and intramural club teams since 2005 as one-part biomechanical expert, one-part yogi&#x2014;a university sage fit for ancient warfare turned sport.<br> <br>The young women smiled and sized me up a little, then passed as I stood beside the chain-link fence entrance to their designated turf. One threw away her melting cone and joined the others who were unpacking the gear from the van&#x2019;s trunk. They spoke not with words, but by exchanging numbers, their ideal scores or degrees to position themselves to hit their targets.<br> <br>The women were preparing for an upcoming Nationals competition.1 (There are no men on this varsity team, only at the intramural level of play.) I watched as they carefully set down their compound and recurve bows&#x2014;like those used at the Olympics, with tips that bend away from the archer&#x2014;then drew and let loose arrows that curved and fell out of sight as they hit the round target face. Davis didn&#x2019;t hover, but stood a good distance behind them, perhaps assessing who might need support. Spread out, farther off at the edge of the turf, were toolkits filled with spools, pliers, wrenches, hammers, and nails.<br> <br>Two archers lined up to shoot. Only one wanted to know her score. Davis was looking with his binoculars downrange, the length of nearly two tennis courts from their location, as one archer let her first arrow fly. I could just hear the sound of a whip cracking the air.<br> <br>&#x201c;Seven at six o&#x2019;clock.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nine at two o&#x2019;clock.&#x201d;<br> <br>Her shots weren&#x2019;t grouping yet.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ten, high.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ten, way high.&#x201d;<br> <br>After the next arrow sailed, there was no sound.<br> <br>&#x201c;No. Don&#x2019;t look at that one!&#x201d; she said, shifting her feet, dropping her bow. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t even think it hit the target.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Davis confirmed, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t even see it.&#x201d;<br> <br>As I stood behind her, trying to place myself in her position, I couldn&#x2019;t imagine how even one had hit the target. Every archer calculates the arc of a rise (the drop and horizontal shifts of an arrow&#x2019;s path), a trajectory only they can predict. Before even accounting for wind speeds, there is always some degree of displacement that happens when the arrow leaves the bow at a skew angle from the target so that the fletching doesn&#x2019;t hit the string upon release. This is how the arrow is crafted. If you are right-handed in archery, you&#x2019;ll aim slightly to the left to hit the bull&#x2019;s-eye. This skill means focusing on your mark, the likely shape of an arrow&#x2019;s arched flight, and the many variables that can knock it off all at once. The most precise archers call this process of dual focus split vision.<br> <br>It also requires constant reinvention&#x2014;seeing yourself as the person who can hit a ten when you just hit a nine, as an archer who just hit a seven, but can also hit an eight. Archery is one of the sports that gives instantaneous, precise feedback. It puts athletes into rank order of how they measure up against their seconds-younger selves. Archers constantly deal with the &#x201c;near win&#x201d;: not quite hitting the mark, but seconds later, proving that they can.<br> <br>If an archer&#x2019;s aim is off by less than half a degree, she won&#x2019;t hit her target. &#x201c;Just moving your hand by one millimeter changes everything, especially when you&#x2019;re at the further distances,&#x201d; said Sarah Chai, a recent Columbia graduate and former cocaptain of the varsity archery team.2 From the standard seventy-five-yard distance from the target, the ten-ring, the bull&#x2019;s-eye, looks as small as a matchstick tip held out at arm&#x2019;s length. Hitting the eight-ring means piercing a circle the size of the hole in a bagel from 225 feet away. And that&#x2019;s while holding fifty pounds of draw weight for each shot.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s a taxing pursuit. Well into a three-hour practice, two of the women were lying down, their backs on the turf behind the shooting line, staring up at the sky. Three hours per day of meditative focus, trying to find what T. S. Eliot would call &#x201c;the still point of the turning world,&#x201d; requires a unique, sustained intensity.3 Living on a landscape where an infinitesimal difference in degree leads to a massive difference in outcome is what makes an archer an archer. It means learning to have the kind of precision that we find in the natural world&#x2014;like that of a bee&#x2019;s honeycomb or the perfect hexagonal shape of the rock formations on Ireland&#x2019;s Giant&#x2019;s Causeway. When archers start getting good, with scores consistently above 1350 (out of 1440), they taper down, shoot less, and attend to their concentration, breathing techniques, meditation, and visualization. One teammate, overwhelmed with exams, still made it up to Baker&#x2019;s fields because the focus she gets from archery calms her about everything. &#x201c;When I was studying abroad, I was going crazy without having it,&#x201d; she said. Without the regimen, she felt irritated all the time.<br> <br>I stayed at the archery practice for three hours. Someone watching me might have wondered why. For all the thrill of discovering a new sport, it was, admittedly, interminable. I hadn&#x2019;t brought binoculars, and it is hard to concentrate for three hours on what is right in front of you but not easily seen. It was also a cold day, but I stayed to witness what I was starting to feel I might never glimpse: &#x201c;gold fever,&#x201d; or &#x201c;target panic,&#x201d; as it&#x2019;s called&#x2014;what happens when an archer gets good, even too good, compared to her expectations, and starts wanting the gold without thinking about process. In extreme cases, it means that one day she is hitting the bull&#x2019;s-eye, the next day her arrows could end up in the parking lot. No one is clear about whether it&#x2019;s choking, a kind of performance anxiety, or some form of dystonia.4 But what we do know is that the only way to recover fully from it is to start anew, to relearn the motions and to focus on the essentials&#x2014;breathing, stance, position, release, and posture. None of the archers I saw seemed to have target panic. Few are willing to admit it even if they do.<br> <br>Yet something else about archery gripped me enough to keep me there. The reason occurred to me as I left practice, walking down Broadway. I stumbled upon a national historic landmark, a restored eighteenth-century Dutch colonial farmhouse owned by the Dyckman family. It once stood on acreage that spanned the width of Manhattan from the Hudson to the East River, but is currently nestled on the busy avenue behind shrubs and foliage, raised and hidden nearly out of sight. The incongruity of the farmhouse on Broadway intrigued me and I went in for a tour. It was, in fact, my second such visit of the day. Watching an archery team in this modern age had been like seeing a similarly ancient relic, a vestige of a past way of work that we rarely spot in action&#x2014;not a contest, where there is a victor, but the pursuit of mastery.<br> <br>The mastery I witnessed on the archery field was not glamorous. There was nobility in it all, but no promise of adulation. There is little that is vocational about American culture anymore, so it is rare to see what doggedness looks like with this level of exactitude, what it takes to align your body for three hours to accurately account for wind speeds and hit a target&#x2014;to pursue excellence in obscurity. It was an unending day in and day out attempt to hit the gold that few will ever behold. Perhaps I noticed it more than I would with the practice required for a more familiar, popular sport such as basketball or football, one with more chance of glory or fame. To spend so many hours with a bow and arrow is a kind of marginality combined with a seriousness of purpose rarely seen.<br> <br>There was another reason. As each arrow left for its target, the archers were caught between success (hitting the ten) and mastery (knowing it means nothing if you can&#x2019;t do it again and again). If I had to hazard a guess, I would say that this tension between the two, the momentary nature of success and the unending process required for mastery, is part of what creates target panic or gold fever in the first place.<br> <br>Mastery requires endurance. Mastery, a word we don&#x2019;t use often, is not the equivalent of what we might consider its cognate&#x2014;perfectionism&#x2014;an inhuman aim motivated by a concern with how others view us. Mastery is also not the same as success&#x2014;an event-based victory based on a peak point, a punctuated moment in time. Mastery is not merely a commitment to a goal, but to a curved-line, constant pursuit.<br> <br>From a certain height, we can see it: Many of our most iconic endeavors&#x2014;from recent Nobel Prize&#x2013;winning discoveries to entrepreneurial invention, classic works of literature, dance, and visual arts&#x2014;were in fact not achievements, but conversions, corrections after an arrow&#x2019;s past flight. I have long had a magpie curiosity about how we become. As an only child who lived in my imagination, I would delve into the life stories of my elders; my contemporaries; historic innovators, creators, and inventors; and those working at the peak of their powers today&#x2014;people whose lives are like mine, but at the same time vastly different from my own. I couldn&#x2019;t escape one observation: Many of the things most would avoid, these individuals had turned into an irreplaceable advantage. I still remember the shudder when I sensed a knowing as sure as fact&#x2014;that I might only truly become my fullest self if I explored and stayed open to moving through daunting terrain.<br> <br>I had been thinking of this for much of my life, though it only occurred to me when I was midway through writing this book. It happened when I went to Cambridge and walked into a down-sloped room on Harvard&#x2019;s campus as Bill Fitzsimmons, the longstanding Dean of Admissions, told us, an audience of alumni, that he had been expelled from high school for truancy. He had fallen in with the wrong crowd and started skipping school. He had to work to apply to another high school in the neighboring town. It gave him a sort of resilience, he said, and something he thinks is critical for life itself. &#x201c;I remember your application,&#x201d; the dean said to me when I went to greet him after the panel. He said it again as if he were sure, as he looked at my nametag with my Harvard college alumni year. He grinned, and pursed his lips as if suppressing a thought.<br> <br>Perhaps he didn&#x2019;t want to disclose what he had recalled and I had forgotten, a memory long-suppressed: I had written my college application essay about the importance and the advantage of failures&#x2014;my own&#x2014;as I perceived them at age eighteen, and in general as a matter of course. I stood there and remembered how I had hidden the essay from my parents and even my college advisor, knowing full well that it was classified as &#x201c;high risk.&#x201d; I revealed it at the last minute so that if there were any objections, the lack of any substitute essay would force their hand and let me send it in. I wanted to explore in writing what I was beginning to sense about life&#x2014;that discoveries, innovations, and creative endeavors often, perhaps even only, come from uncommon ground.<br> <br>In hindsight, I realize that I was focused on improbable rises because I was beginning to live with the gift of what it means to be underestimated. What happens when the world often assumes, before you&#x2019;ve even uttered a word, that you could be a failure&#x2014;based on not fitting a given expectation of the human package in which some expect to find excellence&#x2014;and how have people turned that into an advantage to meet their aspirations, their dreams?<br> <br>It was a belief that had crystalized when I would visit my maternal grandparents, who lived in rural Virginia, in a wooden house that was just about ready to sink into the earth. All that was holding it together, it seemed, was their will and a handyman&#x2019;s attempt. Life for my late grandfather, Shadrach, and grandmother, Blanche, when I was at their house centered around three rooms&#x2014;the kitchen, filled with all sorts of food I prayed they didn&#x2019;t eat; the dining room; and the living room, where we did all the things you&#x2019;re supposed to do in the dining room. Uniting them all was a pass-through chamber where my grandfather would paint his multihued world of characters, both human and divine. He was a janitor by night, a jazz musician always, and a sign painter on the weekends. But at that dining-room table, he would show what he had conjured. The dining room was a place for showing dreams, and his dreams were shaped by hardship. The reality of what he didn&#x2019;t want helped him more clearly conjure what he did, and it aided who he would become. Above all, I would not have written this book without his example.<br> <br>As I stood there in that room in Cambridge, I realized that, fifteen years later, I was still thinking about the unheralded yet vital ways that we re-create our future selves.<br> <br>We have heard the stories: Duke Ellington would say, &#x201c;I merely took the energy it takes to pout and wrote some blues.&#x201d;5 Tennessee Williams felt that &#x201c;apparent failure&#x201d; motivated him. He said it &#x201c;sends me back to my typewriter that very night, before the reviews are out. I am more compelled to get back to work than if I had a success.&#x201d; Many have heard that Thomas Edison told his assistant, incredulous at the inventor&#x2019;s perseverance through jillions of aborted attempts to create an incandescent light bulb, &#x201c;I have not failed, I&#x2019;ve just found 10,000 ways that won&#x2019;t work.&#x201d;6 &#x201c;Only one look is enough.

But by the time the confrontation with Iraq presented itself, our courage and moral certainty seemed to fade in the face of partisan bickering and posturing.</p><p>Now the political left and the Democratic Party are trying to use the demanding aftermath of the war to exploit our national cause for their own political advantage.</p><p>How could we allow ourselves to forget so soon?</p>--from <em>Deliver Us from Evil</em></blockquote><p>Sean Hannity's first blockbuster book, the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <em>Let Freedom Ring</em>, cemented his place as the freshest and most compelling conservative voice in the country. As the host of the phenomenally successful <em>Hannity &amp; Colmes</em> on the Fox News Channel and <em>The Sean Hannity Show</em> on ABC Radio, Hannity has won a wildly devoted fan base. Now he brings his plainspoken, take-no-prisoners style to the continuing War on Terror abroad -- and liberalism at home -- in <em>Deliver Us from Evil</em>.</p><p>"Evil exists," Hannity asserts. "It is real, and it means to harm us." And in these pages he revisits the harsh lessons America has learned in confronting evil in the past and the present, to illuminate the course we must take in the future. Tracing a direct line from Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin through Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden, he reminds us of the courage and moral clarity of our great leaders. And he reveals how the disgraceful history of appeasement has reached forward from the days of Neville Chamberlain and Jimmy Carter to corrupt the unrepentant leftists of the modern Democratic Party -- from Howard Dean and John Kerry to Bill and Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>As Americans face the ongoing war against terrorists and their state sponsors around the world, Sean Hannity reminds us that we must also cope with the continuing scourge of accommodation and cowardice at home. With his trademark blend of passion and hard-hitting commentary, he urges Americans to recognize the dangers of putting our faith in toothless "multilateralism" when the times call for decisive action. For only through strong defense of our freedoms, at home and around the world, can we preserve America's security and liberty in the dangerous twenty-first century.</p></p><p><p>Sean Hannity is the host of radio's <em>The Sean Hannity Show</em> and TV's <em>Hannity,</em> and the author of the <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers <em>Deliver Us from Evil</em> and <em>Let Freedom Ring.</em> His radio show is heard by roughly 13.5 million loyal listeners on 500 stations nationwide.</p>Conservative Fox Television news host and bestselling author Hannity sees behind the ills of the world one cause: evil. And so Hannity joins the "neocon" chorus, positing that totalitarian regimes, such as Hussein's in Iraq, Hitler's Germany and the former Soviet Union, serve as breeding grounds for evil, thus justifying President Bush's policy of pre-emptive action against countries that could threaten American interests. Despite "irrefutable evidence," Hannity writes, today's liberals inexplicably doubt that "absolute evil truly exists," and instead foolishly cling to the idea that the world's problems might arise from social, psychological and cultural differences or from economic inequality. Fans of Hannity�&#x20ac;"Christian conservatives in particular�&#x20ac;"will no doubt embrace this straightforward call to arms. Many readers, however, will find Hannity's "irrefutable" evidence to be anything but, and his selective use of history and circular logic raise far more questions than it settles. Two final chapters examine what Hannity considers to be the dangerous, partisan policies espoused by the current slate of Democratic presidential candidates. For our democracy to survive, Hannity argues, we must root out terrorists and defeat evil totalitarian regimes before they can harm us�&#x20ac;"a theme that will no doubt play loudly this election season. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In this study of the Bible, Skip Moen re-examines the Genesis account from an Hebraic perspective, applying the findings to New Testament themes. This foundation supports a radical revision of contemporary views about women in the home, the world and the church.

A former journalist for the Atlanta Journal Constitution, she lives in Atlanta, Georgia.</p><b>1</b><br>&nbsp;<br><br>It was not an auspicious beginning for a vacation, let alone for a new life. The rain chased her all the way down the East Coast, slashing at the windshield, pounding her car from every angle. Between the backwash from a continuous stream of eighteen-wheelers blowing past her at eighty miles an hour (in contrast to her own sedate fifty-five mph) and violent gusts of wind from the storm, it was all she could do to stay on the roadway.<br>It was her own fault, Ellis decided. She should have stuck to her original plan. She should have gotten up at a sensible hour, at least waiting until daylight to start the drive from Philadelphia to North Carolina. Instead, on some insane impulse, she&#x2019;d simply locked up the town house and driven off shortly after midnight.<br>It was a most un-Ellis-like decision. But then, her old life, back there in Philly, was gone. And somewhere, on that long drive south, she had subconsciously decided that the seeds of a new life must be waiting, at the beach. In August.<br>Ellis took a deep breath and rolled her shoulders, first forward, and then backwards, trying to work out the kinks from six hours of driving. She reached for the commuter mug of coffee in the Accord&#x2019;s cup holder and took a long sip, hoping it would clear the fatigue fog.<br>An hour later, she saw the sign: Nags Head, 132 miles. She smiled. The rain had slowed to a light drizzle. She should arrive at the house, which was called Ebbtide, by around seven.<br>Her smile faded. What had she been thinking? Check-in was at 2 P.M., according to the renter&#x2019;s agreement she&#x2019;d signed.<br>She composed a mental e-mail to herself: To: EllisSullivan@hotmail.com. From: EllisSullivan@hotmail.com. Subject: Failure to plan = plan to fail.<br>But the memo would have to wait. The highway rose and she found herself on a long, gently arching bridge. One more damned bridge. Surely it was the last. The Chesapeake Bay Bridge had nearly done her in. She felt her jaw clench tightly. Her fingertips clamped the steering wheel, and her heart raced. A bead of sweat trickled down her back.<br>Nags Head was on the Outer Banks of North Carolina. She&#x2019;d studied her guidebooks, maps, and AAA Triptik for weeks now. She knew the island&#x2019;s geography, even its topography, intimately. But she&#x2019;d refused to allow herself to focus on the bridge issue. Because the fact was, as the girls knew all too well, bridges&#x2014;even wimpy little bridges like the Sam Varnedoe that separated Whitemarsh and Wilmington islands back home in Savannah&#x2014;scared the living bejeezus out of Ellis Sullivan.<br>She kept her eyes straight ahead, not daring to look right or left at the water flowing under the bridge. When she&#x2019;d finally crossed the bridge, her hands were clammy, her T-shirt sweat-soaked.<br>Now she was on the Outer Banks proper. Signs for the little towns flashed by: Corolla, Duck, Southern Shores, Kitty Hawk, Avalon Beach. The sun rose, and she was somehow shocked at how densely developed the beachfront was here. She&#x2019;d expected to see clumps of sea oats silhouetted against sparkling blue water; sailboats bobbing at anchor; great, gray shingled houses staring moodily out to sea; the occasional lighthouse. The reality was that, so far, what she&#x2019;d seen of the storied Outer Banks could just as well have been the Jersey shore, Myrtle Beach, Fort Lauderdale, or any other East Coast tourist resort&#x2014;meaning miles and miles of hotels and motels, restaurants, and strip shopping centers lining both sides of the road, and a shoreline packed with cheek-to-jowl condo complexes and huge, pastel-painted beach houses.<br>She followed Route 12 south, and when the GPS computerized voice instructed her to turn left and then right, she knew she was getting close. Virginia Dare Trail was the beach road. Here, at least, there was a little bit of elbow room between the houses. Once or twice she actually caught a glimpse of sand dunes and sea oat plumes. Finally, the well-modulated woman&#x2019;s voice announced cheerily, &#x201c;Arrive at destination, on left.&#x201d;<br>Ellis slowed the car and stared. A long crushed-shell drive led through a weedy patch of sand. There was a mailbox at the curb, with a sun-bleached cedar sign in the cutout shape of a whale. EBBTIDE was painted on the sign in faded white letters. The driveway ended at what looked like a two-story garage. The wood-shingled structure was a weathered grayish-brownish affair. Through a set of open wooden garage doors, she spotted a beat-up tan Bronco with a red surfboard strapped to the rooftop rack.<br>To the side of the garage, a rambling three-story wood-frame house arose from a set of wooden stairs. Stretched across the front of the house was a long, open porch. A row of rocking chairs marched across the porch, and a gaudy striped beach towel was draped carelessly across a railing. From the sandy side yard, a wooden walkway led up and over a towering sand dune.<br>On an impulse, she pulled the car into the next driveway. Here, there was no house at all, only the charred remains of a concrete-block foundation, along with some blackened timbers. A black-and-orange NO TRESPASSING sign was posted on a block wall. Ellis put the Accord in park and got out of the car, her cramped legs and back screaming in protest. The air was already hot and muggy. She did a couple of deep knee bends, scanning the yard next door for any signs of life. Had the earlier renters already checked out? Or did the Bronco in the garage belong to somebody who was still enjoying a last hour or two on the beach before it was time to head home?<br>She strolled over to the mailbox and peered up at the house. Their house, at least for the month of August. Ellis intended to make every hour of this month count.<br>&#x201c;Ebbtide,&#x201d; she said aloud, satisfied that the exterior of the house, at least, seemed to match the photo she&#x2019;d spotted in the Vacation Rentals by Owner listing. Of course, that photo had also shown an inviting green lawn dotted with billowing blue hydrangeas and a hot-pink bicycle built for two with a charming wicker basket leaning up against a rose-covered picket fence. None of these were in evidence now. In fact, the only thing in evidence in what passed for a yard, besides a bumper crop of weeds, was a busted-up Styrofoam cooler full of empty malt liquor cans and a sodden heap of yellowing newspapers, still in their plastic wrappers.<br>She glanced down at her watch. She had half a day to kill until check-in. Being Ellis, she&#x2019;d already planned to arrive hours before the others. The extra time would give her a chance to go to the grocery store, prepare their first night&#x2019;s dinner, get the house situated. Linens were not included in the house rental, so she&#x2019;d brought enough sheets and towels for everybody, just in case. And yes, she would have first crack at choosing her bedroom, but since she&nbsp;<i>had</i>&nbsp;done all the legwork finding the house and planning this trip, would anybody really mind?<br>Well, maybe Willa would mind. She was only older than the others by twenty months, but really, she could be so pushy and bossy. It would be just like Willa to accuse Ellis of hogging the best bedroom. Which she had no intention of doing. She just didn&#x2019;t want a bedroom facing the street and a lot of noise. She was a light sleeper&#x2014;and she had a lot of thinking to do. And anyway, as the only single woman in the group, she was used to her own space. Too used to it, she thought wryly.<br>She was dying to see Ebbtide up close. She glanced up and down the road. There was no sign of traffic. Just another sleepy summer morning at the beach. Maybe it wouldn&#x2019;t hurt to walk up the driveway of the burnt-out house to see what she could see. Technically, she knew, it was trespassing. But it wasn&#x2019;t like she was looting the place. What was left to loot?<br>Quickly, before she lost her nerve, Ellis trotted up the crushed oyster-shell drive. Another wooden boardwalk and a set of stairs leading up and over the sand dune, just like the one at Ebbtide, seemed to have survived the fire that had taken this house. She trod the steps quickly, not wanting to be seen from the road.<br>There was a shed-roofed deck at the top of the dunes. At one time it would have been an amazing place to sit and sip a cocktail and enjoy the ocean breezes. But not now. Some of the decking had rotted out, and the railings missed pickets in several places. A couple of broken plastic lawn chairs lay sprawled on their side, but it was the view that captured Ellis&#x2019;s attention. From here she could see the Nags Head she&#x2019;d imagined. The dunes, covered with sea oats, beach plums, and shrubs whose names she didn&#x2019;t know, sloped down to meet a wide, white beach. The tide was out, and the Atlantic Ocean sparkled gray-blue below. Here and there, people walked along the shore, stooping to pick up shells.<br>&#x201c;Perfect!&#x201d; Ellis exclaimed. Just then, she heard the slap of a wooden screen door. Turning, she saw movement from the second-floor apartment over the garage at Ebbtide. That apartment had a small wooden deck wrapping around the sides and back of it. As she watched, a man walked out onto the deck. She could see him clearly&#x2014;good Lord&#x2014;he was in his underwear.<br>The man was barefoot, deeply tanned, with unkempt sun-bleached brownish hair. A pair of baggy white boxer briefs hung low on his slim hips. He turned, faced the water, yawned and stretched. And then, while Ellis watched, slack-jawed with amazement and disgust, he quite casually proceeded to pee off the edge of the deck.<br>He took his own good time about it too. Ellis was rooted to the spot where she stood, her face crimson with embarrassment. When he was finally finished, he stretched and turned. And that&#x2019;s when he spotted her, a lone figure in hot pink capris and a white T-shirt, her long dark hair blowing in the breeze coming off the beach.<br>The man gave her a nonchalant smile. His teeth were white and even, and from here she could see the golden stubble of a days-old beard.

Whether talking about the legacy of slavery, relationships, and marriage in black life, the prose and poetry of Martin Luther King Jr., James Baldwin, Malcolm X, and Maya Angelou, the liberation movements of the 1950s, '60s, and '70s, sexual pain or pleasure, hip-hop and gangsta rap culture, addiction, greed, or the failure of black leadership, hooks lets us know what love's got to do with it.</p><p>Combining the passionate politics of W E. B. DuBois with fresh, contemporary insights, hooks brilliantly offers new visions that will heal our nation's wounds from a culture of lovelessness.</p><p>Her writings on love and its inextricable links to race, class, family, history, and popular culture raise one pivotal question: How can we create beloved American communities? <em>Salvation </em>is bell hooks's journey to answer this question-an offering for everyone who cares about the souls of black folk. </p></p><p><strong>Bell Hooks</strong> is a cultural critic, feminist theorist, and writer. Celebrated as one of our nation's leading public intellectual by <em>The Atlantic Monthly</em>, as well as one of <em>Utne Reader's</em> "100 Visionaries Who Could Change Your Life," she is a charismatic speaker who divides her time among teaching, writing, and lecturing around the world. Previously a professor in the English departments at Yale University and Oberlin College, hooks is the author of more than 17 books, including <strong>All About Love: New Visions</strong>; <strong>RememberedRapture: The Writer at Work</strong>; <strong>Wounds of Passion: A Writing Life</strong>; <strong>Bone Black: Memories of Girlhood</strong>; <strong>Killing Rage: Ending Racism</strong>; <strong>Art on My Mind: Visual Politics</strong>; and <strong>Breaking Bread: Insurgent Black Intellectual Life</strong>. She lives in New York City."The transformative power of love is the foundation of all meaningful social change," contends hooks in this impassioned plea to embattled African-American communities to embrace love as a force for change. Returning to the subject of last year's All About Love, this leading feminist scholar focuses this time on a love ethic that, she maintains, has the potential to undo the long-term effects of neglect, poverty and despair. As in other recent books on black relationships (such as George Edmond Smith and Gwendolyn Goldsby Grant's More Than Sex), hooks refutes the myth stemming from the time of slavery that black people haven't attempted to normalize their lives, citing documentation of familial love and strong community ties. Much of the conflict in relationships between black men and women can be linked, she suggests, to the sense of loss and abandonment arising from increasingly fractured black families; as a result, many members of the hip-hop generation mistrust love. Although hooks covers overworked turf in her chapters on self-love, her flair for crisp writing surfaces again in her celebration of black women's propensity for cultivating love in their communities and in her stinging arguments against the scapegoating of black single mothers. In the later chapters, hooks reaches beyond the theoretical to address various walks of black life. Her fans will delight in her array of cultural references, from Zora Neale Hurston, Cornel West and Erich Fromm to Eldridge Cleaver, Olga Silverstein and Lil' Kim. Despite recent criticism that hooks may have lost some of her bite, this book provides ample evidence to the contrary. (Feb. 1 Forecast: Though it won't defend hooks from the charge that she is rewriting the same book, this effort is more focused and potent that her last. Supported by an 11-city tour that will include events that play to her following among college students, this title should keep hooks's fans satisfied. <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Odilon Redon: Prince of Dreams, 1840-1916</h2><p>The work of French Symbolist painter Odilon Redon has long been seen as a direct link between the 19th century and the development of modern art. Now Douglas W. Druick, Searle curator of European paintings at The Art Institute of Chicago, has gathered more than 500 color and black-and-white reproductions of the artist&#39;s well-known and more obscure works.</p><p>Meticulous research by an international team of scholars, complemented by magnificently reproduced illustrations, creates an impressive portrait of the fin-de-si&#x160;cle French artist Odilon Redon (18401916). Although Redon was once ranked with artists like Seurat and Gauguin, he has lately received less attention than his peers--a situation that the current retrospective at the Art Institute of Chicago, which this volume explicates, should help redress. Redon is best remembered today for his visionary monochromatic prints and drawings. Among his most frequently exhibited pictures are such fantastic dream images as an eye set within an ascending balloon and a giant smiling spider poised at a jaunty angle. Many public collections also display colorful pastel drawings of flower bouquets from the latter part of his career. It has proven difficult to explain his work according to the grand narratives of art history. Redon was neither an impressionist nor a modernist; even the label of symbolist threatens to assimilate his works to literature and philosophy rather than grant them the independence that their singularity demands. The authors, led by the Art Institute's Druick, recontextualize Redon by carefully unraveling his relationship to the romantic esthetics, spiritualist theologies, and art-market imperatives of his time, while offering a convincing psychoanalytic account of how his art reflects his unhappy childhood, his difficult apprenticeship, and his struggle to emerge from the shadow of his talented elder brother. Dark clouds and landscapes from his early life mark his noirs, they argue, but dissolve to reveal the no less mysterious, but finally joyous, light and color of his last decades. Many heretofore unknown full-color images brought to light by their investigations give a fuller sense of the development of themes in this late period. A superb art book for aficionados of occult ideas, of the graphic arts, or simply of striking images and effusive colors. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Redon's art infuses us with wonder, pleasure, and hope. He survived a bewildering and painfully lonely childhood to become a productive, fulfilled, and successful artist--a transformation chronicled in his work, which evolved from stark iconographic depictions of isolation and vulnerability to vibrant images of luminous fecundity. Redon (1840-1916) was an exceptional draftsman, lithographer, pastelist, painter, and decorator, as well as a late bloomer and a wholly original thinker who found inspiration in diverse forms of art and literature and in the revolutionary realms of psychology and science. His work has been sadly neglected since his first retrospective 100 years ago, but his second retrospective has proved to be an exciting and revelatory event, as evidenced by this superb volume. Under the direction of Douglas W. Druick, a curator at the Art Institute of Chicago, a select group of art historians carefully and intuitively trace Redon's fascinating personal history and extraordinary artistic achievements. Nearly 600 reproductions, many of works hitherto unknown to the public, support the text and delight the eye. Redon's compelling work bridged the centuries, forming a golden chain of rich symbolism, glorious romance, gentle mysticism, and sensual celebration. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Same Lake, Different Boat: Coming Alongside People Touched by Disability</h2><p>When the church attempts to function without all of its parts, the body of Christ becomes disabled. <i>Same Lake, Different Boat</i> is a transformational work--designed to renew our minds to think biblically about disability in order that our lives, our relationships, and our congregations might wholly reflect Christ.</p><p><b>Stephanie O.

Salinger, and bring him to a baseball game</p><p>W. P. Kinsella plays with both myth and fantasy in his lyrical novel, which was adapted into the enormously popular movie, <i>Field of Dreams.</i> It begins with the magic of a godlike voice in a cornfield, and ends with the magic of a son playing catch with the ghost of his father. In Kinsella's hands, it's all about as simple, and complex, as the object of baseball itself: coming home. Like Ring Lardner and Bernard Malamud before him, Kinsella spins baseball as backdrop and metaphor, and, like his predecessors, uses the game to tell us a little something more about who we are and what we need."Wild...Romantic...Unconventional...A triumph of hope."<br><br>THE BOSTON GLOBE<br><br>The voice of a baseball announcer tells the Iowa farmer Ray Kinsella: "If you build it, he will come." "He" is Shoeless Joe Jackson, Ray's hero. "It" is a baseball stadium which Ray carves out of his cornfield. Like the movie FIELD OF DREAMS that was made from this novel, SHOELESS JOE is about baseball.

His family gathers at his bedside: his son, young Adam, struggling to maintain his marriage to a radiantly beautiful actress; his nineteen-year-old daughter, Petra, filled with voices and visions as she waits for the inevitable; their mother, Ursula, whose relations with the Godley children are strained at best; and Petra&#x2019;s &#x201c;young man&#x201d;&#x2014;very likely more interested in the father than the daughter&#x2014;who has arrived for a superbly ill-timed visit.<br><br>But the Godley family is not alone in their vigil. Around them hovers a family of mischievous immortals&#x2014;among them, Zeus, who has his eye on young Adam&#x2019;s wife; Pan, who has taken the doughy, perspiring form of an old unwelcome acquaintance; and Hermes, who is the genial and omniscient narrator: &#x201c;We too are petty and vindictive,&#x201d; he tells us, &#x201c;just like you, when we are put to it.&#x201d; As old Adam&#x2019;s days on earth run down, these unearthly beings start to stir up trouble, to sometimes wildly unintended effect. . . . <br><br>Blissfully inventive and playful, rich in psychological insight and sensual detail, <i>The Infinities</i> is at once a gloriously earthy romp and a wise look at the terrible, wonderful plight of being human&#x2014;a dazzling novel from one of the most widely admired and acclaimed writers at work today.</p><p><strong>A Q&amp;A with Author John Banville</strong> <br> <br> <b>Question:</b> Where did you get the idea to use Greek gods as characters in a novel? And then how did you settle on the ones we meet in <i>The Infinities</i>?<p></p> <p><b>John Banville:</b> I have always been an admirer of the great German dramatist Heinrich von Kleist, particularly the play I consider his masterpiece, <i>Amphitryon</i>, which I adapted for the Irish stage. In this wonderful tragi-comedy Jupiter falls for Alcmene, wife of the Theban general Amphitryon, and comes to earth with his son and sidekick Mercury, to spend a heavenly night with the lady; the next morning Amphitryon returns unexpectedly from the wars, precipitating an intricate comedy of errors. Originally I intended to base <i>The Infinities</i> quite closely on Amphitryon, but fiction has its own laws and its own demands, and the finished novel is an autonymous creature, though the Kleist is still there in skeletal form.</p> <p><b>Question:</b> Why did you decide to make Adam Godley a mathematician?</p> <p><b>John Banville:</b> I don&#x2019;t know that I ever actively decided to make him anything."Decisions" in the writing of fiction tend to be mostly a matter of dream and drift. But I wanted him to be someone operating in an otherworld of speculation, pure number, and infinitudes, where the gods might be already at play. </p> <p><b>Question:</b> There is something so classical and familiar about the death bed scene, the family patriarch dying and the family coming from far and wide to gather at his bedside. What about the death bed construct appealed to you as a starting off point?</p> <p><b>John Banville:</b> Again, I didn&#x2019;t think of the book as centering on a death bed scene--and I don&#x2019;t think it does, really--but of course fiction is a tired old business where there is nothing new under even the intensest sun. In fact, one of the pleasures of working in the novel form is the challenge of finding new ways to present old things. Spinoza says somewhere that the wise man thinks only of death but all his thoughts will thereby be a contemplation of life. I hope that&#x2019;s the case with <i>The Infinities</i>, and that everything in it is vividly alive, even the dying old man upstairs.</p> <p><b>Question:</b> Many readers have commented on the humor in this novel. Is it harder for you to write comedy or tragedy (which you have certainly done in previous novels)?</p> <p><b>John Banville:</b> All my books are funny, if you know how to listen for the jokes. The novel, at a certain basic level, is a comic form. Do you know the story of Kafka reading to a group of friends from <i>The Trial</i>, and laughing so much he could not get past the first page? Kafka is a great realist--indeed, one of the greatest--and reality is always funny, though the fun is often steeped in pathos. </p> <p><b>Question:</b> This novel takes place over the course of a single day. Why did you decide on that time structure?</p> <p><b>John Banville:</b> I was following Amphitryon in this--preserving the unities, as the Aristotelians say. There is a nice compactness to the time-scale in the book, which I like. Also the fact of limiting the action to a single day makes for a mysterious sweet melancholy. Everyone has days that will live in the memory for a lifetime; for my characters, that Midsummer Day is one.</p> <p><b>Question:</b> So Hermes is our narrator (though, of course, John Banville is really our narrator). So author as messenger? Author as God? Or is that just reading too much into it?</p> <p><b>John Banville:</b> Well, of course, in the little world of a novel the author is a god, or at least a demigod, watching over his creatures, helping them, if he can, or at least not hindering them. In a wider sense, I find the pagan world of the Greeks highly appealing, and wish we could regain their state of innocence and sophistication. Bring back the old gods, I say.</p> <p> (Photo � Jerry Bauer) </p>John Banville, the author of fourteen previous novels, has been the recipient of the Man Booker Prize, the James Tait Black Memorial Prize, the <i>Guardian </i>Fiction Award, and a Lannan Literary Award for Fiction.

In resonating stories nested one inside the other, Crowley describes Blackbury Jambs, Pa., where among ex-students turned shepherds and mystics turned babysitters, Pierce finally finds himself part of a community and rediscovers the source of his quest, the historical novels of local writer Fellowes Kraft, who has his own stories to tellof young Will Shakespeare, Elizabethan Doctor John Dee's desire to speak with angels and Giordano Bruno's thirst to understand his world, for which he would be burned as a heretic.

Born the son of missionary parents in Korea, David "Tex" Hill has become one of America's most famous and beloved fighter aces. "Tex" Hill: Flying Tiger recounts his intriguing early life, standout career, and non-stop adventures of all kinds. Tex's story is inescapably intertwined with those of Claire Chennault, the famed 'Flying Tigers', and the nation of China, and this book weaves all three fascinating storylines into a masterful tapestry, certain to entertain and educate. Tex and his grandson relate Hill's exploits through his naval aviation days and on to the Far East, where a motley collection of maverick airmen and ground crew-the American Volunteer Group---changed the face of the war in China and Burma through unparalleled valor. The story then moves to Tex's command of America's first jet equipped fighter squadron and the creation of the Texas Air National Guard. The authors include a hardhitting assessment of the failures and missed opportunities that changed China's stance toward America and the West just a few short years after their wartime alliance. Finally Tex's forays into the realms of Hollywood filmmaking, African biggame hunting, mineral mining in Mexico, and operating oil interests in south Texas round out the tale, providing an insightful look into the life of one of World War II's premier flying legends.</p><p></p><h2>The Memory Quilt: A Christmas Story for Our Times</h2><p>T.D.

Lela Edwards asked, hastily twisting the volume control knob on the clock radio, abruptly quieting "O Come, All Ye Faithful" to an unrecognizable muffle. </p><p> "'She's <i>filed</i>,' I said." </p><p> Phone conversations with Jean were like this -- begun without much small talk. Barely a hello, and she was off with the subject like a sprinter at the sound of the gun. </p><p> "Darcie filed for divorce," she said, skipping a few beats before she added, "Mother, don't start." </p><p> "What am I starting? I'm just trying to understand what you're saying," Lela said. </p><p> Jean sighed. "Darcie filed for divorce yesterday." She said the words slowly, as if reluctant to repeat herself. </p><p> "I <i>thought</i> you said a few months ago that they were <i>thinking</i> of getting a divorce. Here the child's barely been married a year. Didn't they even <i>try</i> to work things out?" </p><p> "Mother, I'm just telling you what's going on." </p><p> Lela brushed away a speck of lint from her blue jersey knit skirt and glanced at the large clock on the wall next to the refrigerator in the long kitchen/dining area. Nine forty-five. She was supposed to leave in five minutes for the Wednesday women's Bible study and here she was hearing news like this. Barbara would be outside honking her horn soon, and nobody wanted to hear that "La Cucaracha" song that Barbara's son had installed in the car. At least she already had her coat on. </p><p> Jean made a noise, as if aware that Lela's attention had strayed. "She's coming here to Missouri City for Christmas, Mother, instead of what you and she talked about." </p><p> "She can't pick up a phone and tell her grandmama that?"This was supposed to be the perfect Christmas -- or near perfect. And that meant having all three of her daughters and her -- she had to say -- favorite granddaughter home for the holidays. </p><p> "Mother, you lecture." </p><p> "Lecture?" </p><p> "That's why <i>I'm</i> telling you. Besides...I want Darcie here with me, Mother. She's two months from her due date. This is the last time she can fly here." </p><p> "She lives in Indiana, Jean. She'd rather fly a thousand miles to Texas than drive here to spend Christmas with her grandmama like she promised?" </p><p> "Mother...she's feeling vulnerable right now -- " </p><p> "And that's <i>another</i> reason why the girl don't need to be divorced." She tried to ignore the echo of her own lectures given to the girls over the years, filled with "Don't say <i>don't</i> if you mean <i>doesn't</i>." </p><p> "Now she's gonna be a single mother -- " Lela thought out loud. </p><p> "Tell that to Doug, Mother. He's the reason this divorce is happening right now." </p><p> "I still don't understand -- " </p><p> She was interrupted by the sound of a horn blaring the first notes of "Jingle Bells." Lela shook her head, grateful at least that the song had been changed to something less tacky than "La Cucaracha." "That's Barbara. I gotta go. We'll discuss this later." </p><p> "Mother..." </p><p> In the silence that followed, Lela suddenly sensed an ocean's worth of words left unsaid or words she wished had been unsaid over the years, washed along by a tide of unmet expectations. She was tired of swimming against the current. "I told you Barbara's waiting." </p><p> "Have you given any thought to what I suggested last week? About your moving here? The neighborhood's getting bad and -- " </p><p> "Barbara's waiting, Jean." </p><p> "Okay. Love you." Yet Jean's words sounded a little reluctant. </p><p> "Love you too." Lela snapped o the radio, rubbing her shoulder as she stood. "Arthur" was kicking up today. She hoped her arthritis-strength ibuprofen was in her purse. </p><p> As she headed to the front door, she absently searched for Smokey -- a stray she'd picked up around her garbage can the previous month. Somebody's throwaway, she surmised. The kitten had a weird grayish coloring that she could almost swear was blue (but cats weren't <i>blue</i>, were they?). She didn't know what kind of cat he was. But she'd named him after Smokey Robinson, the famous R &amp; B singer. She'd felt sorry for him until she got the bill to deworm him. </p><p> Barbara's horn sounded "Jingle Bells" again. </p><p> "Hold your horses," she said softly. Barbara couldn't hear her from this distance. She squeezed into her black pumps, knowing she would regret the choice later, before grabbing the purse and Bible waiting on an end table. </p><p> <i>Wonder if I need a hat</i>. She fingered the gray locks curling just above her shoulders. She stuck a hand out the door to get a sense of the temperature. Good. The weather was mild. She hated covering up her new haircut. The wind picked up under a sky that was a weak pastel blue but didn't look to deposit snow anytime soon. The 45 degree temperature was too high for that. If the weather continued like this, it looked to be a brown Christmas in two weeks. That was fine with her. She hated driving in the snow. </p><p> Her best friend, Barbara Wiggins, at seventy-three -- two years older -- still liked to drive in any kind of weather, and so be it. Lela grunted as she folded herself into Barbara's silver PT Cruiser. The scent of bayberry -- one of Barbara's favorite scents -- immediately enfolded her. </p><p> "'Bout time," said Barbara, running a hand along her short, salt-and-pepper, mostly salt afro. </p><p> "Sorry. That was Jean on the phone. Told the girl I had to go." </p><p> "Jean? Everything okay?" Barbara put the car in gear. "O Holy Night" blared from WMBI on the radio. </p><p> Lela sighed, wondering how much to reveal. She didn't feel like getting into it with Barbara. "Everything's fine." </p><p> Barbara's glance was wry. "If you say so. As if I didn't know better judging by how you look right now." </p><p> "Just drive, girl." </p><p> "Yes'm." Barbara saluted, as she headed north -- the only way they could go, with Laflin being a one-way street -- toward Morgan Park. </p><p> Lela sighed as they passed the last of the bungalows on the long block of 117th and Laflin. This was the kind of residential neighborhood that some didn't believe still existed on the far southeast side of Chicago. People didn't expect more than projects, burned-out buildings, and crime stats here now. But there were still some houses around, even if they weren't looking as well kept up as they had been twenty years ago. Lela blamed the decline of the neighborhood on the new blood on the block, some of whom -- like the woman in the last house on the northeast corner -- were merely renting. Key people, owners who acted as neighborhood watch people and were house-proud, had moved away over the years. There were more and more signs of a gang's influence now, with graffiti scrawled across an abandoned building here and there on 119th Street or even across a garage door. </p><p> Still, she was pleased to see that many of the houses at least were decorated for Christmas. More than a few houses boasted the large snow globe that the block club picked out. Surprisingly, the "newbies" knew how to follow instructions and kept things uniform. </p><p> Lela was one of the few residents left who had purchased the houses when they were built between 1963 and 1965. Her particular house was bought in 1964, a year after Barbara and her husband bought theirs. Walt and Lela were able to purchase the house only because the financing fell through for another couple bidding on it, an event she attributed to God's mercy. </p><p> The neighborhood hadn't changed much, ethnically speaking. It was still African American for the most part, suggesting that racial segregation was still an issue in some parts of Chi-Town. </p><p> In less than fifteen minutes Barbara pulled up at the corner of 112th and Vincennes adjacent to the old Catholic school housing Briarwood Baptist. What a relief. Unlike on Sunday mornings, they didn't have to park two blocks away. </p><p> Lela's feet were already hurting from the tight shoes by the time they reached the red-brick fellowship hall, the first building north of the sanctuary. And they still had to descend a flight of stairs to the basement level and Fellowship Room 1, where the senior women's Bible study met. She grunted down each one, wondering not for the first time why the <i>senior</i> women had to struggle down the stairs while the <i>junior</i> women met on the first floor. Why couldn't they drag <i>themselves</i> down here and switch with the senior women? Maybe she would talk to Pastor about that. </p><p> She sighed as she entered the table-lined double room with its cream-colored walls, enlivened by framed posters depicting various types of flowers. </p><p> There were about fifty in the group and forty who showed up regularly. Since the church had made a considerable effort to combat the segregation evident on the South Side, different races were represented. About thirty women were there now, carrying on the traditional "Christmas clash," with half the group in a myriad of red and green Christmas sweaters and the other half favoring jewel-toned sweaters (in purple, yellow, and blue) -- all looking like living Christmas ornaments. </p><p> Estelle, the new widow, had shown up. But, Lela wondered, why? She was only forty-five, hardly senior. Most of the other women were fifty-five at least. And she usually dressed like a hussy, just like today. Here it was ten AM and she had on a skin-tight purple two-piece out t like she was going to a club or something. She was slim and petite but now reminded Lela of a grape. <i>Who is she trying to impress?</i> Lela thought to herself. </p><p> Lela nodded a greeting. Her smile was much warmer as she turned to Nita Juarez, who promptly handed her a small, foil-covered bowl. </p><p> "Mole as promised," Nita said, a mischievous grin highlighting her impish face. "Put that over your chicken, okay?" </p><p> Lela smiled. "Girl, I might have gas as a result, but I'm sure gonna eat this. Thank you. Uh, <i>gracias</i>." </p><p> Nita smiled and patted her arm as if Lela had performed a cute trick. "<i>De nada</i>." </p><p> "Everybody get settled so we can get started, ladies." As usual, Lorraine Collins, the Bible study leader, didn't need a microphone. Her deep voice carried across the long fellowship room...</p></p><h2>More Than Fire: A World of Tiers Novel</h2><p>Philip Jose Farmer is one of the living giants of the science fiction genre. His first published story, "The Lovers" (1952), won him the Hugo Award for Best New Writer and launched one of the most important careers in the history of the field. Perhaps the Riverworld novels and stories are the best known of his more than 90 books. Certainly next in rank of popularity has been his World of Tiers series.<br>Beginning in the 1960s with The Maker Of Universes, and continuing in The Gates Of Creation, A Private Cosmos, Behind The Walls Of Terra, and The Lavalite World, Kickaha, an Earthman travels, fights, loves his way across the pocket universes. He is the implacable enemy of the decadent and arrogant Lords, a combatant who could have stepped out of the pages of Joseph Campbell's The Hero With A Thousand Faces. And Kickaha's greatest and most deadly foe is the Lord, Red Orc.<br>Now, in More Than Fire, Farmer concludes this epic series with the ultimate battle between Kickaha and Red Orc, with the entire existence of the pocket universes at stake. The long-awaited climax of one of the most popular and long-running adventure series in the history of science fiction is a colorful, complex, bloodthirsty, sexy explosion. The fast-paced story spans many worlds of wonders, reveals many secrets of the history of the World of Tiers, and ends with a shout of victory.</p><p>Hugo Award-winner Farmer ( Red Orc's Rage ) returns to his popular World of Tiers for a disappointing conclusion. Tiers (like Earth) is in a continuum of often very different "pocket" universes, created by the super-powerful Lords. These universes are connected through interdimensional gateways, like the one that 20th-century earthman Paul Janus Finnegan crossed to find the tiered world of Alofmethbin and become Kickaha the Trickster. Since then, Kickaha has lived an adventurous and heroic life trying to thwart Red Orc, who plans to recover the lost secrets of making and destroying universes in order to annihilate all other universes and create his own. For the most part, Kickaha and his lover, Anana, wander aimlessly from universe to universe until they're captured by Red Orc, who (in the manner of foolish villains everywhere) toys with them long enough for Kickaha to escape and force a final climactic confrontation. The World of Tiers novels were always mainly action and adventure--nothing deep--but here Farmer fails to deliver even that: the action is flat, the plot hopelessly contrived, the characters less engaging than in previous outings and the new worlds less vivid. And the prose is often worse than even pulp adventure should be: "Sometimes he glimpsed art forms that seemed to have been originated by an insane brain. But that was because of his own cultural mindset." Even die-hard fans of this series will likely be disappointed. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.Farmer's World of Tiers yarns--a mingling of classical and American Indian mythology, William Blake-ish romanticism, and Edgar Rice Burroughs-like high adventure--have been appearing variously since 1965; this book (according to the publishers) presents the ultimate showdown between the hero, Kickaha, and Lord Red Orc--one of the arrogant and decadent super-race that created the Tiers, a succession of pocket universes (the Tower of Babylon tier, the Atlantis tier, the Amerind tier, etc.). Though recent volumes have been presented for review in these pages, series fans will wish to investigate. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

He appears regularly on EWTN with Scott Hahn.<b>Introduction<br>The Mass Is What We Do</b><br><br>The Mass is what Catholics do. It&#x2019;s the heart of Catholic life, for individuals and for the community. <br><br>A Catholic may fill up hours with devotional prayers and volunteer service, public witness, and almsgiving. <br><br>A parish may sponsor a school and a soup kitchen, a scouting troop and several Bible study groups.<br><br>The Mass, however, is the heart that gives life to all of it. Our tradition describes the Mass beautifully as &#x201c;the source and summit of the whole Christian life.&#x201d; Catholicism means many things to the world. It has inspired the art and architecture of the great masters. Our sanctuaries have echoed with masterworks of music. Our saints have served the poorest of the poor. Yet all these things we trace back to a single source: the Mass.<br><br>Catholics think of the Mass as synonymous with the parish church. Whether we say &#x201c;I went to church&#x201d; or &#x201c;I went to Mass,&#x201d; we mean the same thing. Even if we do many other things at our church, the Mass is what the building was made for. To &#x201c;go to church&#x201d; is to go to Mass. This is true for every Catholic. When the pope travels to distant lands, the news media pay close attention&#x2014; and the world watches as he simply does what Catholics do: he celebrates<br>Mass, sometimes for a congregation of hundreds of thousands of people.<br><br>Yet such a large-scale event is no greater than the usual Mass in an ordinary parish. It is the same, in its essence, as<br>a Mass that a military chaplain offers on the hood of a Jeep during a lull in a battle.<br><br>The Mass is the most familiar and recognizable element of the Catholic faith; and still it is also the most enigmatic. In the Mass we see postures, gestures, and items of clothing that would seem out of place anywhere else. We hear words that hint at deep and ancient mysteries. Even the more familiar words sometimes mean something quite different<br>from their meaning in ordinary usage.<br><br>The words, the vestments, and the gestures of the Mass took their origins in times long past. Nevertheless, they hold infinite meaning for Catholics today. For we believe that the Son of God took flesh and became man in a particular time and place, and that he used the language and culture of that time and place to convey truths that speak to every age and nation. Jesus insisted on this point; and so, &#x201c;on the night he was handed over, took bread, and, after he had given thanks, broke it and said, &#x2018;This is my body that is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.&#x2019; In the same way also the cup, after supper, saying, &#x2018;This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.&#x2019; For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the death of the Lord until he comes&#x201d; (1 Corinthians 11:23&#x2013;26).<br><br>He said, &#x201c;Do this,&#x201d; and so <i>this &#x2014;</i> the Mass &#x2014; is what we Catholics do.<br><br>We find the experience more rewarding, however, when we understand the Mass as we pray it. And that&#x2019;s the reason<br>for this book.<br><br>In the chapters that follow, we&#x2019;ll look at all the elements that go together to make up a typical Mass. We&#x2019;ll define some basic terms. We&#x2019;ll outline the parts of the ritual. We&#x2019;ll look at each and every part from up close. We&#x2019;ll examine the prayers.

We&#x2019;ll trace some prayers and practices back to their historical and biblical roots. We&#x2019;ll take a slow walk through the Mass, stopping to see the sights along the way.<br><br>It&#x2019;s not a very original idea, we acknowledge. Saint Cyril of Jerusalem and Saint Ambrose of Milan produced such<br>books in the fourth century. Great saints have followed suit. In the last century, many more such books appeared, from authors as great as Monsignor Ronald Knox and Archbishop Fulton Sheen.<br><br>Why do Catholics need new books to go over the same ground? Saint Augustine addressed God as a truth &#x201c;ever ancient and ever new.&#x201d; The prayers and signs do come to us from venerable antiquity, and they remain basically the same. Yet some details change, as the rites make their home in different times and cultures. We&#x2019;ve changed, and so our experience of the Mass has changed. It&#x2019;s time for us to take a fresh look, from where we sit now&#x2014;and from where we stand and kneel.</p><h2>After Virtue</h2><p>First published in 1981this edition has a new final chapter which elaborates on the connections between philosophy/history and moral philosophy/theology.</p><p>Morality, according to Alasdair MacIntyre, is not what it used to be. In the Aristotelian tradition of ancient Greece and medieval Europe, morality enabled the transformation from untutored human nature as it happened to be to human nature as it could be if it realized its <i>telos</i> (fundamental goal). Eventually, belief in Aristotelian teleology waned, leaving the idea of imperfect human nature in conflict with the perfectionist aims of morality. The conflict dooms to failure any attempt to justify the claims of morality, whether based on emotion, such as Hume's was, or on reason, as in the case of Kant. The result is that moral discourse and practice in the contemporary world is hollow: although the language and appearance of morality remains, the substance is no longer there. Disagreements on moral matters appeal to incommensurable values and so are interminable; the only use of moral language is manipulative.<p> The claims presented in <i>After Virtue</i> are certainly audacious, but the historical erudition and philosophical acuity behind MacIntyre's powerful critique of modern moral philosophy cannot be disregarded. Moreover, independently of its principal claims, the book, first published in 1981, helped to stimulate philosophical work on the virtues, to reinvigorate traditionalist and communitarian thought, and to provoke valuable discussion in the history of moral philosophy. It was so widely discussed that MacIntyre added another chapter to the second edition in order to reply to his critics. <i>After Virtue</i> continues to deserve attention from philosophers, historians, and anyone interested in moral philosophy and its history. <i>--Glenn Branch</i></p>Alasdair MacIntyre is Research Professor of Philosophy at the University of Notre Dame.

No feldspar or quartz is categorized hereDrather, Christian (The Bookstore Mouse) muses on a variety of rocks that children typically encounter, such as flat "skipping" rocks ("you toss it out in the water just so and see it trip across the surface, making a chain of spreading rings") to a "wishing rock ("with a stripe running all the way round it... it must circle all the way. You whisper what you want before you throw it"). Christian imbues her words with a childlike sense of wonder that lifts the everyday to the extraordinary, a transformation intensified by superb book production. Hewing to an earth-toned palette, Lember's (A Book of Fruit) photos are spare and uncluttered, alternating between tightly focused shots (small hands holding various stones, for instance) with broader pastoral vistas, such as a boy leaping from rock to rock across a creek. A slight soft-focus effect helps suspend the subjects in timeDdespite the backpacks and sneakers, these children could be from any era. The book's design is exemplary as well; the words are matted against broad swaths of white space, while the glossy sheen of the photographs stands out vividly. A work of art in every regard.

But one balmy June evening, that quiet life begins to fall apart after Brady receives a frantic phone call from his friend and client Dalton Lancaster. Dalt is in the emergency room, having been severely beaten by a group of thugs who warned him that he has a week to pay off his debt. Even worse, the message comes directly from Paulie Russo, the head of the Boston mob. Dalt swears he has no such debt, but when Brady tries to intercede, Russo lets him know he is holding Brady responsible for his client's obligation. Then Dalt disappears and no one seems to know whether he's fled for his life or been murdered -- until the ransom demand arrives.While Brady tries to rescue Dalt, and himself, from the escalating situation, his live-in girlfriend Evie buys a one-way ticket to California to care for her dying father, leaving Brady to wonder when -- or if -- she will return.</p><p><p><b>William G. Tapply</b> was the author of numerous books on fishing and wildlife, as well as more than twenty books of crime fiction, including <i>Out Cold</i>. He lived in Hancock, New Hampshire.</p>ONE-WAY TICKET (Chapter One)<p>June bugs and fireflies were flitting around in the walled-in garden behind our townhouse on Beacon Hill. Overhead, an almost-full moon and a skyful of stars lit up the Boston evening. Now and then a myopic moth would alight on the screen of our little portable TV, which was sitting on our picnic table.</p><p>Evie and I were slouching side by side in our comfortable wooden Adirondack chairs with sweaty bottles of Sam Adams in our hands, as we often did on a pleasant June evening when the Red Sox were playing. Henry David Thoreau sprawled on the bricks beside us, his legs occasionally twitching with dog dreams. Baseball put Henry to sleep. From our backyard we imagined that we'd heard the roar of the Fenway crowd all the way from Kenmore Square when David Ortiz hit one over the bullpen in the third inning.</p><p>At the end of the sixth inning, Evie yawned, stood up, stretched, and said she was exhausted. She kissed the back of my neck and stumbled into the house and up to bed. Evie enjoyed baseball. She liked the geometric symmetry of it and the occasional remarkable feat of athleticism, but she wasn't really a fan. She didn't care enough about who won, and she didn't understand the passionate neuroses of lifelong Red Sox addicts such as I, who had seen the home team squander so many late-inning leads over the years that we were never comfortable until after the final out. We knew there was always a Bucky Dent or a Bill Buckner lurking around the corner, waiting to break our hearts. The aberration of 2004 would never ease our apprehensions.</p><p>"It's only a game," Evie would point out while I clenched my fists on every pitch. "And besides, they play about two billion of them a year."</p><p>"It's not only a game," I would say. "It's life in a nutshell."</p><p>One inning and half a bottle of beer later the Sox were clinging to an uncomfortable 9-6 lead. The Orioles had runners on first and third with only one out when the phone rang.</p><p>We'd brought the portable kitchen phone outside with us, so I was able to grab it on the first ring, before the one beside our bed disturbed Evie, I hoped.</p><p>When I answered, a voice I didn't recognize said, "Mr. Coyne?"</p><p>"Yes," I said, "this is Brady Coyne, and it's almost eleven o'clock on a Tuesday night. You better not be trying to sell me something."</p><p>Henry, hearing the tone of my voice, sat up, yawned, and arched his eyebrows at me. I reached over and scratched his forehead.</p><p>"This is Robert Lancaster," said the guy on the phone. "I don't know if you remember me. I'm here with my father. Dalton Lancaster."</p><p>"We met once," I said. "You were about eight. Your parents were in the middle of a divorce. You and your dad and I had lunch together."</p><p>"That's right," he said. "That was about twelve years ago."</p><p>I waited, and when he didn't continue, I said, "So where's 'here'?"</p><p>"Excuse me?"</p><p>"You said you were there with him."</p><p>"Oh. The emergency room at the New England Medical Center."</p><p>"Who's hurt?" I said. "You or Dalt?"</p><p>"Him. My father."</p><p>"Is he okay?" I said.</p><p>"They say he's going to be all right. He wants to talk to you."</p><p>"So what happened?"</p><p>"He got beat up."</p><p>"Who--?"</p><p>"I don't know. Three guys. He says he doesn't know who they were."</p><p>"Well, okay," I said, "put him on."</p><p>"He's wondering if you'd be able to meet with him."</p><p>"Sure. We can set something up."</p><p>"No," he said. "He means now."</p><p>"Listen," I said. "Whatever happened to your father, client or no client, it's late and I'm tired and I intend to watch the rest of the ball game and then crawl into bed with my girlfriend, who's waiting upstairs for me. Just put him on the phone and we'll set up an appointment."</p><p>"Thing is," said Robert Lancaster, "they jumped him in the parking lot, kicked him in the face, loosened a couple teeth, cut his tongue, banged up some ribs, and he can't talk very well. He's pretty scared, and he says he needs your help."</p><p>"They kicked him?"</p><p>"That's what he says."</p><p>"A mugging, huh? They robbed him?"</p><p>"I don't know. He says they didn't take anything."</p><p>"Just kicked him."</p><p>"I guess so," said Robert Lancaster.</p><p>"Did he call the police?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Tell him to report it to the police," I said. "That's what he needs to do."</p><p>He blew a quick breath into the phone. "Look, I'm sorry, okay? He called me. I said, 'Why are you calling me? You never call me.' He said, 'I got a problem, and I need you to come over here.' I said, 'What about all those times I had a problem? Did you come over?'" He paused. "Anyway, he called, I went. Now I'm here and I'm calling you."</p><p>"You're the one he called," I said. "You being his only son."</p><p>"Me being convenient," said Robert. "I live in Brighton. I go to BU. I took the T over. Look. He's hurt pretty bad, Mr. Coyne."</p><p>"So I should come right away, too," I said. "Since I'm his lawyer as well as his friend."</p><p>"That's the message. If you can't do it, I'll tell him."</p><p>I blew out a breath. "Yes. Okay. He's my client. That's what I do. When are they releasing him?"</p><p>"In a few minutes, I'd say. They've patched him up, given him a prescription. He's finishing up some paperwork."</p><p>I thought for a minute. "There's a little bar-and-grill on Tremont Street, place called Vic's, stays open late for the after-theater folks, five minutes from where you are. Know where it is?"</p><p>"We'll find it," he said.</p><p>"Just around the corner from Boylston," I said. "I'll meet you guys there in fifteen or twenty minutes. You get there first, grab a booth and order me a cup of coffee."</p><p>"You got it," said Robert Lancaster.</p><p>I clicked off the phone, verified that the Sox had not blown their lead, turned off the TV, and took the phone and the TV into the house. Henry followed behind me.</p><p>I went up to our bedroom and opened the door. In the dim light from the hallway I saw Evie mounded under the covers. She was lying on her side facing away from the doorway. The curve of her hip made me smile.</p><p>I went in, sat on the bed beside her, and touched her shoulder. "Hey," I said softly.</p><p>She didn't respond.</p><p>I leaned over, lifted the hair away from her neck, and kissed her on the magic spot where her neck joined her shoulder.</p><p>She moaned softly, then rolled onto her back. She blinked her eyes, focused on me, and smiled. "Did we win?" she mumbled.</p><p>"It's not over," I said. "We're ahead. Sorry to wake you up. I--"</p><p>"I wasn't really asleep," she said.</p><p>"You feel all right?"</p><p>"It's nothing."</p><p>"What's the matter, honey?"</p><p>"Little headache, that's all."</p><p>"Why don't I get you some aspirin."</p><p>"Sure," she said. "That's a good idea."</p><p>I went into the bathroom, shook a couple of aspirin tablets into my palm, filled a glass with water, and took them back to the bedroom. I sat beside Evie and propped her up with my arm so she could take the pills.</p><p>"Thanks," she said. She sighed, lay back on her pillow, and closed her eyes.</p><p>"You going to be all right?"</p><p>"Oh, I'll be fine," she said. "Overtired, I guess. You coming to bed?"</p><p>"Not yet. I've gotta go meet a client."</p><p>"Huh?" Her eyes popped open, and she frowned at me. "What's up?"</p><p>"I don't know," I said. "I'm meeting him at Vic's on Tremont Street. I'll be back soon. You go to sleep."</p><p>"Anybody I know?"</p><p>"Just a client, honey."</p><p>"This time of night?"</p><p>"A lawyer's work is never done," I said. I touched her cheek. "Feel better, okay?"</p><p>"Yes, sir." She closed her eyes and smiled. "Kiss me."</p><p>"Yes, ma'am." I bent over and kissed her mouth.</p><p>Her hand touched my face. "Come right back, please."</p><p>"I will."</p><p>"Be safe."</p><p>"Always," I said.</p><p>ONE-WAY TICKET Copyright 2007 by William G.

But then an uninvited guest from Bill&#x2019;s past upends the Bohannons&#x2019; Fourth of July barbecue, revealing in levelheaded Bill the most unexpected behavior&#x2014;behavior that awkwardly drops Ten in the middle of a crumbling marriage. Ten makes an unexpected move of his own when he agrees to pro bono work for a convicted felon. But it was dope slinger Godfrey Chambers Ten had repeatedly busted during his days on the force, not the reformed and rechristened G-Force who is now asking for Ten&#x2019;s help in claiming money left to him by a kind-hearted benefactor&#x2014;and contested by the benefactor&#x2019;s self-serving family. Soon Ten&#x2019;s investigations lead him down the darkest corridors of the Internet and halfway around the globe to Sarajevo as he navigates the seedy worlds of human trafficking and personal regret. As his cases intertwine, Ten will rely on the wisdom of the Buddha and his own network of relationships&#x2014;with super hacker Mike, outrageously idiosyncratic assistant Kim, old monastery friends Yeshe and Lopsang, Serbian cabbie and former policija Petar, and, of course, feline rock Tank&#x2014;to solve the puzzle �and keep free of his own tangled past.

Great storyline, refreshingly different characters and dazzling insights when you least expect them. -- David Michie, author of The Dalai Lama&#39;s Cat Tenzing &#39;Ten&#39; Norbu may be the most interesting PI in modern crime fiction. The Third Rule of Ten, the third book in the series, is beautifully written and intricately plotted, but as always, it&#39;s the heart and soul of Ten that carry the greatest appeal, drawing the reader on a spiritual journey that is as satisfying as the climax. I loved this book. -- Robert Ferrigno, New York Times best-selling author of the Assassin trilogy The Third Rule of Ten will grab you by the throat and not let go.

Lovecraft pioneered a new type of weird fiction that fused elements of supernatural horror with concepts of visionary science fiction. Lovecraft&#39;s tales of cosmic horror revolutionized modern horror fiction and earned him the reputation as the most influential American writer of weird tales since Edgar Allan Poe. This omnibus collects for the first time in a single volume all of Lovecraft&#39;s groundbreaking fiction: &#39;The Call of Cthulhu&#39;, &#39;The Dreams in the Witch House&#39;, &#39;The Haunter of the Dark&#39;, &#39;At the Mountains of Madness&#39;, &#39;The Shadow out of Time&#39;, &#39;The Shadow over Innsmouth&#39;, the full-length novels &#39;The Case of Charles Dexter Ward&#39; and &#39;&#39;The Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath&#39;, and many others. [This book] is part of Barnes and Noble&#39;s Library of Essential Writers. Each title in the series presents the finest works - complete and unabridged - from one of the greatest writers in literature in magnificent, elegantly designed hardback editions. Every volume also includes an original introduction that provides the reader with enlightening information on the writer&#39;s life and works.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>To Be Human</h2><p><i>To Be Human </i> presents Krishnamurti's radical vision of life in a new way. At the heart of this extraordinary collection are passages from the great teacher's talks that amplify and clarify the nature of truth and those obstacles that often prevent us from seeing it. Most of these core teachings have not been available in print until now. <br><br>Besides presenting the core of Krishnamurti's message, the book alerts the reader to his innovative use of language, the ways in which he would use "old words with new interpretations," then gives practical examples, showing that we can clarify our understanding of life itself&#x2014;and act on this new understanding. <br><br>The splendid introduction by David Skitt discusses Krishnamurti's philosophy as a guide to knowledge and experience, the roles knowledge and experience should play in our lives, and the times when it is best to cast them aside and "look and act anew." The book's source notes will aid the inquisitive reader who wishes a deeper understanding of this great teacher's message.</p><p>Jiddu Krishnamurti (1895&#x2013;1986) was one of the most influential spiritual teachers of the twentieth century. He traveled and lectured throughout the world until his death at the age of ninety. His talks and works are preserved in more than seventy books."Few modern thinkers have integrated psychology, philosophy, and religion so seamlessly as Krishnamurti."&#x2014; <i>Publishers Weekly </i><br>"Captivating."&#x2014;<i>Yoga Journal </i><br>"Krishnamurti's teaching confronts the reader with insights that continually unfold and deepen. This new collection will be treasured by students of Krishnamurti as well as spiritual seekers from a variety of backgrounds."&#x2014; <i>Branches of Light </i></p><h2>The Elusive Obvious or Basic Feldenkrais</h2><p>The Elusive Obvious deals with simple, fundamental notions of our daily life that through habit become elusive. Time is money is obviously a good attitude to have in business or work. It is not at all obvious that in love the same attitude is the cause of so much unhappiness. We often make mistakes. We carry over from one activity to another attitudes of mind that do not make life what it could be. romance is obviously a fine thing. Romantic love is enchanting, but not so good if one partner is money-minded and the other is romantic. In time, they will finish at the psychiatrist&#39;s or in court. Many troubled relationships come from inadvertently carrying over seemingly good habits of thought to where they do not apply. Somehow we behave as if good habits are always good. We think or rather feel that we need not bother about behaving otherwise. It is not so obvious that good habits can make us unhappy. It is an elusive truth. Yet habitual lack of free choice is often, nay, usually, disastrous. If you come across something obviously new to you, in its form at least, please stop for a moment and look inward. Working out new alternatives assists us to grow stronger and wiser. My editor tells me that I should free readers from having to think and look inward. I believe she knows what the average reader likes. I myself do not like predigested food. For you, the reader, I have added to the beginning and end of each chapter a short introduction and summary to facilitate your digestion so that you will find it easier to make what is elusive more obvious.</p><p>Moshe Feldenkrais considers himself not a therapist but a teacher. In both his individual, hands-on body work and his group classes he guides clients to discover for themselves what normal or optimum movement feels like. This sensing will the reprogram or rewire the brain accordingly. This is a new kind of learning. There is no one correct way. Each pupil discovers his own correction functioning for hinself. It is a joyful experience, which works on body, mind, and feelings simultaneously. The changes are dramatically visible, not only in better functioning but in a whole new self image.</p><h2>How to Profit from Your Faults</h2><p>Here is practical guidance for turning imperfections to one&#39;s advantage. Author Joseph Tissot wrote this book to help readers gain a proper sense of themselves and an accurate perspective on their own failings. Drawing on the wisdom of St. Francis de Sales and other great saints, as well as a rich understanding and broad experience of human nature, Tissot offers practical guidance for the interior struggle.</p><p></p><h2>We Shall See Him As He Is: The Spiritual Autobiography of Elder Sophrony</h2><p>&#34;Now at the close of my life I have decided to talk to my brethren of things I would not have ventured to utter earlier, counting it unseemly....&#34; Thus wrote Archimandrite Sophrony, then ninety-two years old, in We Shall See Him as He Is, his spiritual autobiography. In this book Fr. Sophrony, one of the most beloved orthodox Christian elders of our times, revealed to the world his own experience of union with God, and the path to that union. drawing near to God with intense love and longing accompanied by struggle, self-emptying and searing repentance, Fr. Sophrony was granted to participate in the life of God Himself through His uncreated Energies. Like orthodox saints throughout the centuries, he experienced God&#39;s grace as an ineffable, uncreated Light. It was in this Light that Christ was transfigured on Mount Tabor before His Apostles, and it is in this Light that we shall see Him as He is (I John 3:2). Born into a russian orthodox family in Moscow in 1896, Archimandrite Sophrony embarked on a successful career as a painter in Paris. There he delved into Eastern religions for a time, before repenting bitterly of this and returning to the faith of his childhood. After a brief period of theological study in Paris, he left for the ancient orthodox monastic republic of Mount Athos in Greece, where he spent fifteen years in a monastery and a further seven as a hermit &#34;in the desert.&#34; on Mount Athos he became the spiritual son of a simple monk of holy life, Elder Silouan. It was under the guidance of Saint Silouan that Fr. Sophrony experienced divine illumination, knowing God intimately as Personal Absolute-as the one Who revealed Himself to the Prophet Moses as &#34;I AM&#34; and Who became incarnate as man in Jesus Christ. In 1959, Fr. Sophrony founded the Monastic Community of St. John the Baptist in Essex, England, which has since become a major orthodox spiritual center for all of Western Europe. Elder Sophrony reposed in 1993, at the age of 97.</p><p></p><h2>Rise of the Federation: A Choice of Futures (Star Trek: Enterprise)</h2><p><b>An original novel set in the universe of <i>Star Trek: Enterprise</i>!</b><br><br>A new nation has arisen from the ashes of the Romulan War: the United Federation of Planets, an unprecedented union of diverse species cooperating for the good of all. Admiral Jonathan Archer&#x2014;the former captain of the Earth starship <i>Enterprise</i>, whose efforts made this union possible&#x2014;envisions a vibrant Federation promoting galactic peace and a multispecies Starfleet dedicated to exploring strange new worlds. Archer&#x2019;s former crewmates, including Captain T&#x2019;Pol of the <i>U.S.S. Endeavour</i> and Captain Malcolm Reed of the <i>U.S.S. Pioneer</i>, work with him to secure that bright future. Yet others within the Federation see its purpose as chiefly military, a united defense against a dangerous galaxy, while some of its neighbors view that military might with suspicion and fear. And getting the member nations, their space fleets, and even their technologies to work together as a unified whole is an ongoing challenge. <br> <br>When a new threat emerges from a force so alien and hostile that negotiation seems impossible, a group of unaligned worlds asks Starfleet to come to its defense, and the Federation&#x2019;s leaders seize the opportunity to build their reputation as an interstellar power. But Archer fears the conflict is building toward an unnecessary war, potentially taking the young nation down a path it was never meant to follow. Archer and his allies strive to find a better solution . . . but old foes are working secretly to sabotage their efforts and ensure that the great experiment called the Federation comes to a quick and bloody end.</p><p>Christopher L.

They could have been human children back on Earth, if not for the color of the grass and trees, and if not for the subtle V-shaped notches between their brows. Some of the parents had been urging their children to victory, while other, less competitive-minded ones were content to let their kids just run and play, some recording the event with cameras while others simply basked in the light of the bright yellow-white star overhead.<br> <br>And then something had come out of that light, faint specks against the sun&#x2019;s disk. Before they could even be resolved into ships, they had begun firing, bolts of fierce yellow-green plasma tearing into the ground, the buildings, the people. The parents in the square, quicker to understand what was happening, began to panic before the children did. A few managed to stay calm, tried to rally the others to gather up the children and flee to safety. But then a plasma bolt tore through the metal sculpture at the center of the square, sending out shrapnel that felled many of the parents and children nearby. The shock wave left him looking up at the sky from ground level as bodies fell around him. The ships flew overhead, and he recognized them: angular bronze polyhedrons, most only big enough for two people, but undeniably powerful. He watched helplessly as one of the larger, more elongated ships set down in the square and opened to disgorge the raiders, who began methodically shooting down the surviving parents, seizing the screaming, crying children and dragging them back to the ship.<br> <br>He knew those faces too: bald, cantaloupe-green, textured like stucco. The faces of Suliban.<br> <br>One of the raiders reached him, loomed above him, a rifle barrel pointed at his head. He studied that mottled face closely, unafraid of the weapon, knowing he could do nothing to affect what he saw. He could only watch as the raider crouched, a hand reaching forward to fill his field of view&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. leaving only blackness.<br> <br>&#x201c;There! Do you see?&#x201d;<br> <br>With a heavy sigh, Admiral Jonathan Archer reached up and took the virtual display visor off his head, the blackness lifting away to reveal the gray-walled conference room of the Grentra, a warship in the Tandaran fleet. His hands shook slightly as he lowered it, and he made an effort to still them, feeling a twinge of frustration. Doctor Phlox had assured him the latest round of treatments would hold off the tremors for months.<br> <br>But after a moment, he realized that his shakiness was probably an emotional response to the sensory playback he&#x2019;d just experienced, recovered from a proud parent&#x2019;s holorecorder by the Tandaran soldiers who&#x2019;d come to Kemsar Colony to aid the survivors and investigate the brutal raid. Anyone would have been shaken after watching the attack from the vantage point of one of its victims.<br> <br>Archer gathered himself and turned his gaze to the portly, dark-featured Tandaran who had spoken. Valk wore the quilted gray tunic of the Tandaran military, his twin black sashes declaring him an officer and the golden rank pins on the sides of his brown leather collar marking him as a general. &#x201c;No one&#x2019;s disputing what happened here, General Valk. It&#x2019;s a terrible crime, and the Federation extends its sympathies for your loss.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sympathies don&#x2019;t heal mortal wounds, Admiral,&#x201d; Valk fired back. &#x201c;Nor do lies. Let me remind you, the only reason we agreed to tolerate your upstart government&#x2019;s grant of asylum to Suliban refugees was in exchange for your assurances that there would be no Suliban retaliation for our&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. disputes with them over the years.&#x201d;<br> <br>Archer resisted an undiplomatic reply to the general&#x2019;s choice of words. They both knew the history perfectly well. In response to the Suliban Cabal&#x2019;s decade-long war against the worlds of the Tandar Sector, the Tandaran government had imprisoned innocent Suliban civilians, lifelong citizens of Tandaran society, in brutal internment camps&#x2014;allegedly to protect them from the persecution of the masses or forced impression into the genetically enhanced ranks of the Cabal. It had been over eight years since the factions in the Temporal Cold War had ended their intrusions into the twenty-second century, leaving the Cabal with no instructions from the future to guide them or genetic enhancements to motivate them. The directionless Cabal had fragmented, some former members using their augmentations for petty piracy and crime, others simply fleeing from the Tandarans, Klingons, and others whom they&#x2019;d wronged in service to their twenty-eighth-century sponsor&#x2019;s unknowable agendas. But it had been years more before the Tandaran government, having killed or imprisoned most of the Cabal&#x2019;s surviving leaders and suffering no further attacks, had consented to close the camps once and for all, under pressure from Tandaran activists who had learned of the conditions there from former prisoners like the ones Archer had helped free a decade ago.<br> <br>But the Suliban had still faced fear and bigotry from many in the Tandar Sector, and while some had chosen to reclaim their homes there and try to rebuild their lives and relationships, many had chosen to resume their nomadic ways or relocate to other worlds, including some within the territory of the United Federation of Planets&#x2014;the fledgling union of United Earth, the Confederacy of Vulcan, the Andorian Empire, the United Planets of Tellar, and the Alpha Centauri Concordium. Jonathan Archer, who had played a significant role in bringing that union about, had used his clout to persuade the Federation Council to grant the refugees asylum as one of its first acts. More importantly, he&#x2019;d persuaded the Tandaran government to accept that grant, although in return they&#x2019;d insisted that the Federation erase all records indicating that the Tandarans were aware of the Temporal Cold War, as part of some sort of disinformation campaign directed at the future. It sounded fishy to Archer, but he&#x2019;d gone along with it for the sake of the refugees. &#x201c;The Federation has kept its side of the bargain,&#x201d; he assured the general.<br> <br>&#x201c;Then why,&#x201d; Valk asked, &#x201c;have all three of these attacks been along the border closest to your territory?&#x201d; He nodded to his aide, a lean, ash-blond woman named Major Glith, to slide a data tablet across the table toward Archer. &#x201c;And why,&#x201d; the general went on, &#x201c;do the raiders&#x2019; weapons signatures read as consistent with Vulcan and Andorian firearms?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The Vulcans and Andorians were fighting for a long time before they finally made peace,&#x201d; Archer said. &#x201c;Some of their weapons must&#x2019;ve fallen into other hands over the years.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But which hands? Most of the Cabal&#x2019;s members and resources have been accounted for by our intelligence agencies. Yet the biosignatures of these raiders,&#x201d; and he worked a control on his own tablet to send new data to the one before Archer, &#x201c;are not baseline Suliban.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nor do they correspond to any known enhancements,&#x201d; Glith added in a much cooler tone.<br> <br>&#x201c;Then they can&#x2019;t be Cabal, can they?&#x201d;<br> <br>Valk stood and leaned forward, trying to intimidate Archer with his bulk. &#x201c;Or maybe the Cabal has simply found a new set of sponsors willing to protect them from discovery and dole out a different form of genetic edge. Maybe defeating the Romulans has given you humans and your allies a taste for conquest, and you&#x2019;ve decided to go after the Tandar Sector using Suliban as your shock troops!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The Federation is not about expansionism.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t it? For generations, the Vulcan High Command imposed its &#x2018;benevolent&#x2019; interference on its neighbors, often at the point of a plasma cannon. Now they claim to have retreated into pacifism, but only after their human prot�g�s rise to power with unprecedented speed, build a massive war fleet that drives the Romulans into retreat, and assimilate the once fiercely independent Andorian and Tellarite nations! Giving your so-called Federation of Planets the strongest battle fleet outside of the Klingon Empire as a result, even with the Vulcan fleet in mothballs. And no sooner have you dealt with the Romulans than you begin pressuring the Denobulans, Arkenites, and others to submit themselves to your rule as well.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re offering them equal partnership for mutual support and defense. And we don&#x2019;t force it on anyone who doesn&#x2019;t want it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Valk scoffed. &#x201c;Says the man who spent years forcibly interfering in the affairs of the Tandarans, the Klingons, the Mazarites&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;This is getting us nowhere, General!&#x201d; Archer interrupted. The truth was, he couldn&#x2019;t offer a solid defense on this point. The Federation was too new, its identity and objectives still in flux. He knew that the minds behind the Federation saw its purpose as benevolent, but there was still much disagreement over how to fulfill that purpose, or how aggressively to pursue it.<br> <br>&#x201c;We can argue about the Federation&#x2019;s intentions all day long,&#x201d; he continued, &#x201c;but it won&#x2019;t bring those raiders to justice or liberate the children they captured. I came here to offer you the means to do just that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How? If you&#x2019;re not in collusion with these Suliban, how can you track them down when we cannot?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because we know you&#x2019;re looking for the wrong thing.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How do you know this?&#x201d; Glith asked. &#x201c;What do you propose we look for instead?&#x201d;<br> <br>Archer hesitated. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t tell you that. I could tell you what I know, but you&#x2019;d never believe me without proof, and my sources are&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. highly classified.&#x201d; The general scoffed. &#x201c;But what I can do is help you find the raiders and show you who&#x2019;s really behind them&#x2014;and help you get your children back. But you&#x2019;re gonna have to extend us a little trust.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So that you can win your way into our good graces?&#x201d; Valk blustered. &#x201c;Maybe persuade us to submit to absorption into your Federation?&#x201d;<br> <br>Archer faced him squarely. &#x201c;So that those children won&#x2019;t have to live in slavery. Isn&#x2019;t that enough?&#x201d;<br> <br>Valk held his gaze firmly a while longer, reluctant to give any ground, but the reminder of what was truly at stake penetrated his armor, to his credit. &#x201c;Explain to us how you propose to track down the Suliban so long after their warp trails have dissipated.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;d be happy to. Travis?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; Lieutenant Travis Mayweather stepped forward from where he had stood behind Archer, waiting patiently to play his part. The handsome, dark-skinned, bright-eyed officer gave Archer an easy smile and nod as he stepped up to the table, a reminder that the tensions that had arisen between the two men at the onset of the Romulan conflict were now decisively a thing of the past. Admiral Archer was still getting used to the sight of him in the new Federation Starfleet uniform. Although the various space agencies of the UFP&#x2019;s five founding members still existed and oversaw their own ships and specialties within the combined fleet they jointly administered, they&#x2019;d agreed they should adopt a common uniform with elements reflecting all its member states. Mayweather&#x2019;s black undershirt sported a Vulcan-style Mandarin collar; over it was a V-necked tunic worn above a separate pair of black trousers and boots. Archer&#x2019;s own command-division tunic was an avocado green not unlike the command color of the Andorian Guard, while Mayweather&#x2019;s operations-division tunic was reddish-brown per Tellarite military convention. The lieutenant&#x2019;s rank insignia&#x2014;a single gold stripe, as opposed to five alternating wide and narrow stripes for Archer&#x2014;adorned each of his cuffs and shoulder straps. The shoulders were set off by a shallow chevron of gold-fringed navy-blue piping extending from shoulder joints to mid-sternum, reflecting Vulcan designs from the twenty-first century. Below the piping, next to the vertical zipper of the left-hand tunic pocket, was the gold arrowhead insignia of the United Earth Space Probe Agency, the government department that administered Earth&#x2019;s Starfleet. To balance it, the mission patch had moved to the right sleeve, with Mayweather and Archer both bearing the generic Starfleet Command patch, a circular blue field of stars behind a horizontal gold chevron, rather than a specific ship&#x2019;s design. Mayweather&#x2019;s wide-ranging experience during the Romulan War had broadened his interests beyond piloting starships, and he&#x2019;d been a valuable advisor to Archer in this current assignment.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t mean to contradict you, General,&#x201d; Mayweather began in his usual laid-back, conversational tone, &#x201c;but those warp trails haven&#x2019;t completely dissipated. There&#x2019;s still some ion residue out there.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Disconnected traces,&#x201d; Major Glith said, &#x201c;already blended into the interstellar medium.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Almost, but not quite. See, the thing about reconstructing ion trails is that you need to know what you&#x2019;re looking for. You searched for a lot of small trails, right? One for each cell ship?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s correct,&#x201d; the stern-faced major replied.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, we have reason to believe these cell ships aren&#x2019;t capable of warp drive. They would&#x2019;ve had to dock with the two motherships you detected in orbit. So you&#x2019;d be looking for two larger trails instead of a few dozen smaller ones.&#x201d;<br> <br>Glith pondered Mayweather&#x2019;s words for a moment, then turned to Valk. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a plausible notion, General. If the sponsors who provided the Cabal&#x2019;s advanced technology truly have been gone as long as we believe, then the Suliban would be unable to repair those micro-warp drives when they failed. They may have been forced to retrofit their larger vessels with standard drives and rely on the modular nature of the craft to cluster them together.&#x201d; She looked back at the Starfleet officers. &#x201c;But we did scan for the mother-ships&#x2019; traces as well and found nothing conclusive.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mayweather smiled. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s where we can help you, Major. There&#x2019;s a little trick we picked up a few years back in the Delphic Expanse. Helped us track down some Osaarian pirates who&#x2019;d destroyed an alien ship and then ransacked Enterprise. See, what you have to do is model the effect of the warp field&#x2019;s own gravimetric distortions on the ISM&#x2019;s density profile, then correlate that with the ion concentrations to compute the most probable trajectory. We&#x2019;ve already found their most likely course out of this system, which should put us on the right track.&#x201d;<br> <br>Valk was taken aback. &#x201c;If you already found that information, why haven&#x2019;t you shared it with us?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, we would&#x2019;ve told you sooner, sir, but, well, you were talking and it would&#x2019;ve been rude to interrupt.&#x201d; Archer suppressed a chuckle. From anyone else, the comment would&#x2019;ve come across as snide. But Mayweather&#x2019;s natural good humor and openness softened the barb, getting the criticism across without provoking the general&#x2019;s ire. If Valk did take offense, it would be clear that his bluster, not Federation duplicity, would be the source of any further delays in tracking down the raiders.<br> <br>Still, General Valk was slow to let go of his suspicions. &#x201c;So you would have us follow you in pursuit of a trail you claim only you can find. How do we know you won&#x2019;t lead us into ambush?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re welcome to join us aboard my flagship, General,&#x201d; Archer proposed. &#x201c;You can observe the entire operation yourself. And we&#x2019;ll share our sensor telemetry with your ships.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Which have no means of verifying its accuracy without further analysis.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But you&#x2019;ll h...</p><h2>The Winding Ways Quilt (Elm Creek Quilts Series #12)</h2><p>A latest installment in the popular series brings newcomers into the Circle of Quilters who share the original members&#39; struggles to balance their creative lives with their friendship and their work and family demands. By the author of The Quilter&#39;s Homecoming. 125,000 first printing.</p><p>Jennifer Chiaverini is the author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling Elm Creek Quilts series, as well as five collections of quilt projects inspired by the novels. A graduate of the University of Notre Dame and the University of Chicago, she lives with her husband and sons in Madison, Wisconsin.<b></b><p><b>Sylvia</b></p><p>Sylvia woke to a gentle breeze and birdsong beyond the open window. Sitting up in bed and stretching, she saw clouds in the eastern sky, pink with the new light of dawn. Andrew had risen earlier, without waking her, but she knew there was only one place her husband could be at that hour on a Sunday morning. </p><p>She dressed in a light sweater and slacks and went to join her husband, pausing at the top of the grand oak staircase to savor the brief, reverential stillness that descended upon Elm Creek Manor on Sunday mornings. In a few hours, the gray stone artists' retreat would bustle and hum with the sounds of dozens of eager quilters arriving for a week of quilting, friendship, and fun, but for the moment, Sylvia, Andrew, and the manor's other three permanent residents had the estate all to themselves.</p><p>After descending the staircase, grasping a banister worn smooth from the hands of generations, Sylvia crossed the black marble floor of the front foyer and turned to walk down the older west wing of the manor, built by her great-grandfather in 1858. She brushed the wall lightly with her fingertips, wondering what her great-grandparents would think of the changes their descendants had brought to the farm they had founded, nestled in the fertile Elm Creek Valley in central Pennsylvania.</p><p>Voices and the smell of frying sausages drifted to her from the kitchen at the end of the hall. Sarah would be at the stove, no doubt, preparing breakfast for five, but who kept her company? Her husband, Matt, most likely, although usually he was too busy with his caretaker's duties to linger in the kitchen. Perhaps Sarah's best friend and fellow Elm Creek Quilter, Summer, had finished her daily yoga routine early and had decided to lend a hand, taking advantage of the opportunity to contribute more vegetarian options to the meal.</p><p>"Good morning," Sylvia sang out as she entered the kitchen, but she stopped short at the sight of Sarah sitting on a bench and resting her head in her arms on the kitchen table. Her husband tended the stove, a pink calico apron tied around his waist.</p><p>"Morning," Matt said, throwing her a grin over his shoulder and raising a spatula in salute. Sarah managed to lift her head long enough to give Sylvia a pale smile. Then she groaned and let her head drop onto her arms again, her long, reddish-�brown ponytail falling onto an open package of saltine crackers beside her on the table.</p><p>"Goodness, Sarah. Are you ill?" Sylvia sat down on the opposite bench, brushed Sarah's ponytail away from the food, and felt her forehead. Sylvia detected no trace of fever, thank goodness, but the younger woman clearly was not well.</p><p>"I'll be all right." Sarah's voice wavered feebly, belying her words. "I think I finally understand why Summer won't eat meat. I never realized how awful it smells."</p><p>Sylvia thought breakfast smelled delicious, but she knew better than to discuss food with someone suffering from a stomach bug. "Perhaps you should go back to bed, dear. Matthew seems to have everything well in hand, and you wouldn't want to pass on whatever you have to our guests during registration."</p><p>At the stove, Matt choked back a laugh. "I don't think we have to worry about any of them taking home this particular souvenir."</p><p>"We can't be too careful."</p><p>"I'll be all right in a moment." Sarah pushed herself to her feet.</p><p>"It's my turn to fix breakfast and I'm not going to shirk my duty."</p><p>"Shirk away, honey," said Matt. "I have everything under control."</p><p>"Beginning today, we'll have a professional chef on staff again," Sylvia reminded her. " Anna's planning a cold buffet for lunch, but supper will be a gourmet feast. She phoned me with the menu. Mushroom and rosemary soup, salmon filets, an eggplant ratatouille that Summer is sure to love, and chocolate mousse for dessert. Best of all, no more kitchen duty for the rest of us!"</p><p>"I can't wait," Sarah croaked, then pressed her lips together and hurried from the room.</p><p>"She'll be fine," said Matt when Sylvia rose to go after her.</p><p>"Don't worry. Just give her a minute, and she'll be back here scrambling eggs."</p><p>Sylvia wasn't so sure, but she put on a pot of coffee and offered to mix up a batch of biscuits. Just as she was about to dust her hands with flour to knead the dough, Sarah returned, looking remarkably better. She insisted on taking over, and when the younger couple overruled Sylvia's protests, she left them to their work. She filled two travel mugs with coffee -- cream and sugar for her, sugar only for Andrew -- and carried them out the back door and down four steps to the rear parking lot.</p><p>Outside the air was cool from the night and misty, dew fresh on the grass. Insects chirped and buzzed and darted in the sunlight shafting through the forest canopy, the elms barely stirring in the still air. Sylvia knew the day ahead would be warm and humid, but the gray stone walls of Elm Creek Manor would keep their arriving guests cool and comfortable -- as long as she reminded Sarah to open all the windows and keep plenty of lemonade on ice.</p><p>With a mug in each hand, Sylvia crossed the bridge over Elm Creek without spilling a single drop. Andrew's favorite fishing spot, a large, round, flat rock on the creek bank beneath a willow tree, had been her favorite secluded hideaway as a child. Whenever she had needed time alone to think or to cool her temper after an argument with her sister, she had stolen away to the willow and the rock. The musical burbling of the creek never failed to soothe her, and sometimes even now, a woman grown, she favored the private spot for quiet contemplation.</p><p>But she was happy to share it with her dear Andrew.</p><p>She knew better than to scare away the fish by calling out to him when she spied him through the willow branches, that faded, worn fishing cap on his head, a tackle box on the rock by his side. She approached quietly, but her footfalls alerted him when she was still several yards away. He glanced over his shoulder, and his face lit up at the sight of her. "There's my girl," he said, his voice low. Shifting his fishing rod to one hand, he patted the rock beside him.</p><p>Sylvia gladly took the offered seat, handed him his coffee, and rested her head upon his shoulder as he drew her closer. "Anything biting?"</p><p>"No keepers. Not like you." He sipped his coffee and nodded to show it was just the way he liked it. " You're definitely a keeper."</p><p>"I'm glad to know you don't plan to throw me back."</p><p>"Not on your life."</p><p>She smiled, and they sat in companionable silence, watching minnows draw close to the hook and dart away into the shadows. "Sarah and Matt have breakfast cooking," Sylvia remarked. "Sarah seems to be under the weather."</p><p>Andrew grinned. "She's not sick. She's just sick of cooking."</p><p>"No, that's not it. I urged her to return to bed, but she flatly refused." Sarah wasn't a shirker. If anything, she worked herself too hard. "But I think we'll all be happy when Anna Del Maso joins our staff today. We've been without a real chef for too long."</p><p>"If those cookies she brought to her job interview are any indication, she's going to be a great addition to the staff." </p><p>"I couldn't agree more. If she can make a simple sugar cookie taste that delicious, I can't wait to see what she'll do for Judy's going-away party." Sylvia sighed and sipped her coffee. "I only wish it weren't necessary."</p><p>"Judy couldn't turn down such a great offer from an Ivy League school."</p><p>"Of course not. I wouldn't expect her to. But I'll miss her very much."</p><p>"That's only natural. She'll miss you Elm Creek Quilters, too."</p><p>"She's one of our founding members," said Sylvia, steadying a quaver in her voice. "It's difficult to believe this is her last week." The Elm Creek Quilters were fortunate that one of their new hires, Gretchen Hartley, was willing to start right away. Although Gretchen and Judy had very different quilting styles, adjusting the course offerings was a minor inconvenience compared to the upheaval of canceling classes altogether. At least the rest of their staff would remain through the rest of the season, but then..."We won't have Summer for much longer, either."</p><p>"I thought she was staying through the end of September."</p><p>"That's what she says now, but I'm sure once camp wraps up for the season, she'll be eager to move to Chicago before the fall quarter begins."</p><p>"What about her boyfriend? Won't she want to stick around Waterford for him?"</p><p>"I'm not so sure about that. She's more likely to delay her departure for her mother than for Jeremy."</p><p>Andrew chuckled. "Gwen's so proud of her, I wouldn't be surprised if she drove Summer to Chicago and walked her to class on the first day."</p><p>Sylvia smiled at the image of Gwen in a brightly colored gypsy skirt and beaded necklaces escorting her red-faced, twenty-eight-year-old daughter to her first graduate school symposium. "Gwen might do exactly that, if she didn't have her own students to worry about. And if Summer wouldn't faint away from embarrassment."</p><p>"Summer doesn't seem the fainting type."</p><p>"No, I suppose you're right." It was far more likely that the spirited young woman would welcome her mother's companionship. Gwen and Summer were very close, and Sylvia was so happy for them both, so proud of Summer's accomplishments and her prospects, that Sylvia could almost forget to regret her leaving them.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>Andrew finished his coffee, drew in his fishing line, and began packing his gear. "Do you think you'll finish your quilt in time?" he asked.</p><p>"Unfortunately, no. The grand unveiling I had planned for Judy's going-away party will have to wait."</p><p>"Think of it this way." Andrew squeezed her hand in sympathy and helped her to her feet. "Now we'll have an excuse to visit Judy in Philadelphia. A quilt that special ought to be delivered in person."</p><p>Sylvia nodded, but the thought of a future visit was small consolation. She had worked on the quilts all summer in secret, tracing the templates on the back of her favorite fabrics, carefully cutting the pieces, pinning and sewing each curve by hand.</p><p>Winding Ways.

Or is it?</p><p>Reading <i>The Dangerous Husband</i> is like waking up to earthquake weather: Jane Shapiro's second novel exists in an atmosphere where something shattering is always about to happen. Its context is deceptive--New York in the '90s, a world of artists and writers (the narrator is a photographer), elegant dinner parties at chic apartments. But beneath the surface of this polished world there is trouble. Things are not quite right. For a start, the narrator's new husband, Dennis, cannot move two steps without tripping over himself. At one point he falls through a glass tabletop and almost maims his penis. He keeps an albino frog in a bucket in the basement. The frog floats there, colorless, a sign--but of what?<p> Shapiro is that rare breed: a truly funny writer who is also emotional and lyrical and deeply sad. Like Joy Williams, she seamlessly evokes a dark and unmistakable world. In <i>The Dangerous Husband</i> the narrator always feels like she is bluffing, playing the part of the wife, watching herself act the way a woman in love acts, wishing she could stop watching herself, wishing she could escape her acute and menacing self-consciousness. Shapiro describes loneliness in prose so precise it's breathtaking: </p><blockquote> In loneliness, as we know, anyone who cares for you can become the object of a kind of vagrant love: dry cleaner, hair cutter, naturally any masseuse if you visit one; occasionally the doctor, always the nurse. If any of these evinces a bad attitude you can be crushed like a pip. Otherwise, depths of gratitude. The guy who fixes the frame of your eyeglasses (which you will have broken yourself, when you're lonely, by some method like forgetting they're in bed with you and fitfully rolling back and forth and crushing them in the night), this wonderful simple calm optician, holding up your own glasses in delicate fingers. </blockquote> As the story progresses, the narrator begins to fear her husband more and more, and fear isolates her further. While at times the plot edges into the implausible, Shapiro never lets it stay suspended there for long. Even when you can't believe her story, you trust her. By the book's end, I knew I would follow her anywhere. <i>--Emily White</i>Jane Shapiro&#39;s first novel, After Moondog, was a finalist for a Los Angeles Times Book Prize, a New York Times Notable Book, and among the Village Voice&#39;s 25 Best Books of the Year.

High Adventure is Hillary s definitive and wonderfully entertaining memoir of his Himalayan quest, beginning with the 1951 expedition that discovered a possible route up the south slope of Everest, and culminating in the successful expedition of 1953 led by Sir John Hunt. Hillary s memoir takes us step-by step up the slopes of Everest, describing vividly and in great detail the agonizing climb that he and Tenzing Norgay embarked upon, the perils they faced, and the dramatic final ascent that forever secured them a place of honour in the annals of human exploration. <br><br> High Adventure is a mountaineering classic, to be sure. But it is also a thrilling and inspiring story of courage and endurance a story that will captivate a new generation of readers on the 60th anniversary of Hillary s extraordinary achievement.</p><p>Sir Edmund Hillary (1919-2008) was born in New Zealand, and served in the New Zealand Air Force in World War II. He was a participant in the 1951 and 1952 Everest expeditions, and on 29 May 1953, he and the Nepalese mountaineer Tenzing Norgay became the first men to reach the summit of Mount Everest. After being knighted following the ascent, he achieved many more adventuring firsts in surroundings as varied as the Antarctica and the Ganges. He established the Himalayan Trust, an organization devoted to improving the lives of the Himalayan people, which has built schools, hospitals and infrastructure for the isolated mountain communities. Hillary died of heart failure on 11 January 2008 at the Auckland City Hospital.</p><h2>Lords of Sipan: A True Story of Pre-Inca Tombs, Archaeology, and Crime</h2><p>Tells of Dr. Walter Alva&#39;s experinces in Peru as he struggled to excavate and protect the pre-Inca treasures at the lost tombs of the Lords of Sipan</p><p>In February 1987, archaeologist and museum curator Walter Alva was asked to examine a collection of strange artifacts found in the home of a poor grave robber on Peru's remote north coast. The subsequent police inquiry traced the cache to an ancient pyramid at Sipan, where looters had plundered a royal tomb of a little-known civilization called the Moche. This ransacking of the New World's richest archaeological discovery devastated Alva, who had been conducting a ten-year crusade to protect Peru's monuments of the past. What he did not know was that the looted artifacts had already been smuggled out of Peru and into England for re-transport to Los Angeles, where they would be sold to wealthy art collectors and dealers.<br> &nbsp;<br> At Sipan itself, the police, fearing for his safety, were demanding that Alva abandon his search for objects the looters might have missed. His own colleagues were also urging him to leave, believing he was wasting precious resources on an excavation doomed to failure. In the midst of this crisis, Christopher Donnan, the world's most respected Moche scholar, arrived with much-needed cash, supplies, and encouragement, along with the news that precious artifacts were already in the hands of collectors and dealers. Donnan's information proved correct, for in the months to come, looted artifacts reached the hands of Los Angeles Museum of Art trustee Ben Johnson and Nobel Prize-winning physicist Murray Gell-Man. In fact, many of the objects would soon go on display at the prestigious Santa Barbara Art Museum.<br> &nbsp;<br> Meanwhile, U.S. Customs agents had begun an investigation into the smuggling operation, and in March 1988, their unprecedented seizure of pre-Columbian antiquities sent shock waves through the art world. When reports of the raid reached Peru, Alva was having a celebration of his own. The pyramid at Sipan was not the burial place of a single Moche lord but was, like the Valley of the Kings of ancient Egypt, a necropolis containing many lords. At least three tombs, richer in gold and silver than any other site excavated in the Americas, remained intact. To protect their discovery, Alva and his men put down their shovels and picked-up guns, confronting the looters and winning their support.<br><br> Police and Customs agents, however, were much less successful in their efforts to gain the return o the stolen artifacts. A controversial U.S. court decision resulted in the forfeiture to Peru of only 250 of the nearly 3,000 precious objects seized by the police. But an important precedent was set, serious questions were raised about private ownership of national treasures, and the first conviction in U.S. history for smuggling pre-Columbian art was obtained.Sidney D.

Saleem grows up to learn the ominous consequences of this coincidence. His every act is mirrored and magnified in events that sway the course of national affairs, his health and well-being are inextricably bound to those of his nation; his life is inseparable, at times indistinguishable, from the history of his country. Perhaps the most remarkable are the telepathic powers linking him with India's 1,000 other "midnight's children," all born in that initial hour and endowed with magical gifts. <br>&nbsp;<br>This novel is an once a fascinating family saga and an astonishing evocation of a vast land and its people--a brilliant incarnation of the universal human comedy. Over twenty-five years after its publication, Midnight's Children stands apart as both an epochal work of fiction and a brilliant performance by one of the great literary voices of our time.</p><p>Anyone who has spent time in the developing world will know that one of Bombay's claims to fame is the enormous film industry that churns out hundreds of musical fantasies each year. The other, of course, is native son Salman Rushdie--less prolific, perhaps than Bollywood, but in his own way just as fantastical. Though Rushdie's novels lack the requisite six musical numbers that punctuate every Bombay talkie, they often share basic plot points with their cinematic counterparts. Take, for example, his 1980 Booker Prize-winning <i>Midnight's Children</i>: two children born at the stroke of midnight on August 15, 1947--the moment at which India became an independent nation--are switched in the hospital. The infant scion of a wealthy Muslim family is sent to be raised in a Hindu tenement, while the legitimate heir to such squalor ends up establishing squatters' rights to his unlucky hospital mate's luxurious bassinet. Switched babies are standard fare for a Hindi film, and one can't help but feel that Rushdie's world-view--and certainly his sense of the fantastical--has been shaped by the films of his childhood. But whereas the movies, while entertaining, are markedly mediocre, <i>Midnight's Children</i> is a masterpiece, brilliant written, wildly unpredictable, hilarious and heartbreaking in equal measure.<p> Rushdie's narrator, Saleem Sinai, is the Hindu child raised by wealthy Muslims. Near the beginning of the novel, he informs us that he is falling apart--literally: </p><blockquote>I mean quite simply that I have begun to crack all over like an old jug--that my poor body, singular, unlovely, buffeted by too much history, subjected to drainage above and drainage below, mutilated by doors, brained by spittoons, has started coming apart at the seams. In short, I am literally disintegrating, slowly for the moment, although there are signs of an acceleration.</blockquote> In light of this unfortunate physical degeneration, Saleem has decided to write his life story, and, incidentally, that of India's, before he crumbles into "(approximately) six hundred and thirty million particles of anonymous, and necessarily oblivious, dust." It seems that within one hour of midnight on India's independence day, 1,001 children were born. All of those children were endowed with special powers: some can travel through time, for example; one can change gender. Saleem's gift is telepathy, and it is via this power that he discovers the truth of his birth: that he is, in fact, the product of the illicit coupling of an Indian mother and an English father, and has usurped another's place. His gift also reveals the identities of all the other children and the fact that it is in his power to gather them for a "midnight parliament" to save the nation. To do so, however, would lay him open to that other child, christened Shiva, who has grown up to be a brutish killer. Saleem's dilemma plays out against the backdrop of the first years of independence: the partition of India and Pakistan, the ascendancy of "The Widow" Indira Gandhi, war, and, eventually, the imposition of martial law.<p> We've seen this mix of magical thinking and political reality before in the works of G�nter Grass and Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez. What sets Rushdie apart is his mad prose pyrotechnics, the exuberant acrobatics of rhyme and alliteration, pun, wordplay, proper and "Babu" English chasing each other across the page in a dizzying, exhilarating cataract of words. Rushdie can be laugh-out-loud funny, but make no mistake--this is an angry book, and its author's outrage lends his language wings. <i>Midnight's Children</i> is Salman Rushdie's irate, affectionate love song to his native land--not so different from a Bombay talkie, after all. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Born at the stroke of midnight at the exact moment of India s independence, Saleem Sinai is a special child. However, this coincidence of birth has consequences he is not prepared for: telepathic powers connect him with 1,000 other midnight s children all of whom are endowed with unusual gifts. Inextricably linked to his nation, Saleem s story is a whirlwind of disasters and triumphs that mirrors the course of modern India at its most impossible and glorious</p><h2>The AESOP for Children</h2><p>One hundred twenty-six best-loved fables of Aesop.</p><p>A Collection of Fables from Aesop with the moral at the end of each story. Some of the stories are: The Wolf and the Kid, The Frogs and the Ox, Belling the Cat, The Fox and the Grapes, The Plane Tree, The sheep and the Pig, The Oak and the Reeds, The Rat and the Elephant, The Two Goats, The Wolf and the Sheep, The Pacock, The Fox and the Lion, the Heron, The Mule, The Two Pots, Three Bullocks and a Lion, The Milkmaid and her Pail, The North Wind and the Sun, The Boy and the Nettle and many others. Beautifully illustrated throughout by Milo Winter.Aesop (ca. 620-564 BC), known for the genre of fables ascribed to him, was by tradition born a slave and was a contemporary of Croesus and Solon in the mid-sixth century BC in ancient Greece. The earliest Greek sources (including Aristotle) indicate that Aesop was born in Thrace at a site on the Black Sea coast which would later become the city Mesambria; a number of later writers from Roman imperial period (including Phaedrus, who adapted the fables into Latin), say that he was born in Phrygia. By the 10th century A.D., according to the Suda, Samos and Sardis also claimed to be his birthplace.</p><h2>$12 Million Stuffed Shark: The Curious Economics of Contemporary Art</h2><p>Why would a smart New York investment banker pay twelve million dollars for the decaying, stuffed carcass of a shark? By what alchemy does Jackson Pollock&#39;s drip painting No.5 1948 sell for $140 million? &#39;The $12 Million Dollar Stuffed Shar&#39;k is the first book to look at the economics of the modern art world, and the marketing strategies that power the market to produce such astronomical prices. Don Thompson talks to auction houses, dealers, and collectors to find out the source of Charles Saatchi&#39;s Midas touch, and how far a gallery like White Cube has contributed to Damien Hirst becoming one of the highest-earning artists in the world.</p><p>Don Thompson is an economist and professor of business who has taught at the LSE and Harvard Business School. He lives in Toronto.January 13, 2005, New York<br><br>One problem for the agent trying to sell the stuffed shark was the $12 million asking price for this work of contemporary art.* Another was that it weighed just over two tons, and was not going to be easy to carry home. The taxidermy fifteen-foot tiger shark &#x201c;sculpture&#x201d; was mounted in a giant glass vitrine and creatively named <i>The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living</i>. It is illustrated in the center portion of the book. The shark had been caught in 1991 in Australia, and prepared and mounted in England by technicians working under the direction of British artist Damien Hirst.<br><br>Another concern was that while the shark was certainly a novel artistic concept, many in the art world were uncertain whether it qualified as art. The question was important because $12 million represented more money than had ever been paid for a work by a living artist, other than Jasper Johns &#x2013; more than for a Gerhard Richter, a Robert Rauschenberg, or a Lucian Freud.<br><br>Why would anyone even consider paying this much money for the shark? Part of the answer is that in the world of contemporary art, branding can substitute for critical judgment, and lots of branding was involved here. The seller was Charles Saatchi, an advertising magnate and famous art collector, who fourteen years earlier had commissioned Hirst to produce the work for �50,000. At the time that sum was considered so ridiculous that <i>The Sun </i>heralded the transaction with the headline &#x201c;50,000 For Fish Without Chips.&#x201d; Hirst intended the figure to be an &#x201c;outrageous&#x201d; price, set as much for the publicity it would attract as for the monetary return.<br><br>The agent selling the shark was New York-based Larry Gagosian, the world&#x2019;s most famous art dealer. One buyer known to be actively pursuing the shark was Sir Nicholas Serota, director of London&#x2019;s Tate Modern museum, who had a very constrained budget to work with. Four collectors with much greater financial means had shown moderate interest. The most promising was American Steve Cohen, a very rich Connecticut hedge fund executive. Hirst, Saatchi, Gagosian, Tate, Serota, and Cohen represented more art world branding than is almost ever found in one place. Saatchi&#x2019;s ownership and display of the shark had become a symbol for newspaper writers of the shock art being produced by the group known as the Young British Artists, the yBas. Put the branding and the publicity together and the shark must be art, and the price must not be unreasonable.<br><br>There was another concern, serious enough that with any other purchase it might have deterred buyers. The shark had deteriorated dramatically since it was first unveiled at Saatchi&#x2019;s private gallery in London in 1992. Because the techniques used to preserve it had been inadequate, the original had decomposed until its skin became heavily wrinkled and turned a pale green, a fin had fallen off, and the formaldehyde solution in the tank had turned murky. The intended illusion had been of a tiger shark swimming toward the viewer through the white space of the gallery, hunting for dinner. The illusion now was described as entering Norman Bates&#x2019; fruit cellar and finding Mother embalmed in her chair. Curators at the Saatchi Gallery tried adding bleach to the formaldehyde, but this only hastened the decay. In 1993 the curators gave up and had the shark skinned. The skin was then stretched over a weighted fiberglass mold. The shark was still greenish, still wrinkled.<br><br>Damien Hirst had not actually caught the now-decaying shark. Instead he made &#x201c;Shark Wanted&#x201d; telephone calls to post offices on the Australian coast, which put up posters giving his London number. He paid �6,000 for the shark: �4,000 to catch it and �2,000 to pack it in ice and ship it to London. There was the question of whether Hirst could replace this rotting shark simply by purchasing and stuffing a new one. Many art historians would argue that if refurbished or replaced, the shark became a different artwork. If you overpainted a Renoir, it would not be the same work. But if the shark was a conceptual piece, would catching an equally fierce shark and replacing the original using the same name be acceptable? Dealer Larry Gagosian drew a weak analogy to American installation artist Dan Flavin, who works with fluorescent light tubes. If a tube on a Flavin sculpture burns out, you replace it. Charles Saatchi, when asked if refurbishing the shark would rob it of its meaning as art, responded &#x201c;Completely.&#x201d; So what is more important&#x2013;the original artwork or the artist&#x2019;s intention?<br><br>Nicolas Serota offered Gagosian $2 million on behalf of Tate Modern, but it was turned down. Gagosian continued his sales calls. When alerted that Saatchi intended to sell soon, Cohen agreed to buy.<br><br>Hirst, Saatchi, and Gagosian are profiled later in the book. But who is Steve Cohen? Who pays $12 million for a decaying shark? Cohen is an example of the financial-sector buyer who drives the market in high-end contemporary art. He is the owner of SAC. Capital Advisors, LLC in Greenwich, Connecticut, and is considered a genius. He manages $11 billion in assets and is said to earn $500 million a year. He displays his trophy art in a 32,000 square foot mansion in Greenwich, a 6,000 square foot pied-�-terre in Manhattan, and a 19,000 square foot bungalow in Delray Beach, Florida. In 2007 he purchased a ten bedroom, two acre estate in East Hampton, New York.<br><br>To put the $12 million price tag in context it is necessary to understand how rich really rich is. Assume Mr Cohen has a net worth of $4 billion to go with an annual income of $500 million before tax. At a 10 percent rate of return &#x2013; far less than he actually earns on the assets he manages &#x2013; his total income is just over $16 million a week, or $90,000 an hour. The shark cost him five days&#x2019; income.<br><br>Some journalists later expressed doubt whether the selling price for<i> Physical Impossibility</i> actually was $12 million. Several New York media reported that the only other firm offer aside from that made by Tate Modern came from Cohen, and the actual selling price was $8 million. <i>New York Magazine</i> reported $13 million. But the $12 million figure was the most widely cited, it produced extensive publicity, and the parties agreed not to discuss the amount. At any of these numbers, the sale greatly increased the value of the other Hirst work in the Saatchi collection.<br><br>Cohen was not sure what to do with the shark; it remained stored in England. He said he might donate it to the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York &#x2013; which might have led to his being offered a position on the MoMA board. The art world heralded the purchase as a victory for MoMA over London&#x2019;s Tate Modern. London&#x2019;s <i>Guardian</i> newspaper bemoaned the sale to an American, saying: &#x201c;The acquisition will confirm MoMA&#x2019;s dominance as the leading gallery of modern art in the world.&#x201d;<br><br>* * *<br><br>I began the journey of discovery that became this book at the Royal Academy of Arts in London where on October 5, 2006, along with six hundred others, I attended a private preview of <i>USA Today</i>, an exhibition curated by the same Charles Saatchi. This was billed as an exhibition of art by thirty-seven talented young American artists. Many were not in fact American-born, though they were working in New York &#x2013; an illustration of how hard it is to label an artist.<br><br>The Royal Academy is a major British public gallery. Founded in 1768, it promotes its exhibitions as comparable to those at the National Gallery, the two Tate galleries, and leading museums outside the United Kingdom. The <i>USA Today</i> show was not a commercial art fair, because nothing was listed as for sale. Nor was it a traditional museum show, because one man, Charles Saatchi, owned all the work. He chose what was shown. The work would appreciate in value from being shown in such a prestigious public space, and all profit from future sales would accrue to Saatchi.<br><br>Saatchi is neither a professional curator nor museum official. Over a four-decade career he has been both the most talked-about advertising executive of his generation, and later the most talked-about art collector. He is wildly successful in reselling art he has collected at a profit, Damien Hirst&#x2019;s shark being but one example.<br><br>There was criticism of Saatchi both for using the Royal Academy to advance the value of his own art, and because some considered the work decadent or pornographic. The artists present at the opening had no illusions about the nature of the event. One called the Royal Academy the &#x201c;temporary home of the Saatchi Gallery.&#x201d; Another said it was good to see his art on the wall because it might not be displayed again until it was offered at auction.<br><br>Extensive promotion of the show produced huge press coverage. It was hyped pre-opening by every major newspaper in London, by the<i> New York Times</i>, the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, and a dozen other major U.S. papers. Billed as an exhibition of shocking work, the show included a battle scene involving rats, and an image of a girl performing a sex act on a man.<br><br>The theme of <i>USA Today</i> was billed as disillusionment with contemporary America. Critics and curators at the private opening had diverging opinions of the theme and the work. Some questioned whether the artists could properly be described as disillusioned, or even talented. Norman Rosenthal, the Royal Academy&#x2019;s exhibitions secretary, said the work &#x201c;introduces a sense of political edge and anger mixed with nostalgia; this is an exhibition for our times.&#x201d; Critic Brian Sewell said: &#x201c;At least <i>Sensation</i> [Saatchi&#x2019;s previous exhibition] made me feel nauseous. This made me feel nothing.&#x201d; Ivor Abrahams, a sculptor who sits on the RA exhibitions committee, added: &#x201c;It&#x2019;s schoolboy smut and a cynical ploy to get Saatchi even more noticed.&#x201d; Such is the range of opinion common to contemporary art. Saatchi&#x2019;s own contribution was: &#x201c;Please be my guest at <i>USA Today</i>, and leave me a note if you think that anything there is truly more tasteless than so much we see around us every day.&#x201d;<br><br>The next day the show opened to the general public. Ticket holders shuffled through the galleries in near silence, emotions muted. The crowd looked as if it was queuing to sign the condolence book before Princess Diana&#x2019;s funeral. As is true with much contemporary art, no one seemed anxious to admit they neither understood nor liked what was being shown. At the end people filed out, talking softly, absorbing the experience, neither pleased nor shocked.<br><br>What kind of contemporary art did Charles Saatchi choose for the show? Jonathan Pylpchuk from Winnipeg, Canada showed a miniature army camp containing black American GIs with amputated legs &#x2013; some writhing, others dead. The title is<i> Hopefully, I Will Live Through This With a Little Bit of Dignity</i>. Beijing-born and Vancouver-raised Terence Koh&#x2019;s <i>CRACKHEAD</i> is a death fantasy of 222 glass vitrines with distorted black heads in plaster, paint, and wax, for which Saatchi said he had paid $200,000. Koh also offered a neon rooster titled <i>Big White Cock</i>.<br><br>French artist Jules de Balincourt&#x2019;s <i>US World Studies II</i> is a map showing the United States upside down, with the Mississippi River dividing Democratic states on the left from Republican states on the right. The rest of the world, in small scale, is at the bottom of the map. An artist actually born in New York and improbably named Dash Snow, offered a work called <i>F*** the Police</i>, which consists of a collage of forty-five newspaper clippings discussing police misdeeds, over which the artist had sprayed semen &#x2013; his own presumably. Twenty-five-year-old Snow already had achieved earlier notoriety in the New York City art community for running a graffiti gang called Irak, and for performance art called <i>The Hamster&#x2019;s Nest</i>, which involved naked girls and hundreds of shredded phone books.<br><br>By consensus, the most offensive work was Pakistani artist Huma Bhabha&#x2019;s wire figure with a primitive tail, dressed in a black garbage bag with outstretched arms and positioned in what seemed to be the Islamic prayer position (illustrated). Bhabha, forty five, makes sculptures of found materials which are, she says, about the human condition. Her work at <i>USA Today</i> seemed at first glance to be half-man, half-rat. However, critic Waldemar Januszczak said in the <i>Sunday Times</i> (London), &#x201c;There&#x2019;s only one likely reading of this work . . . as a religious specimen in which evolution has gone into reverse. Hence the tail.&#x201d;<br><br>Judging art is supposed to have less to do with the content of a work and more to do with an instinctive sense for what the artist has to say. Kirsten Ward, who is a physician and psychologist, says that art has the greatest impact when it makes the thinking part of the brain talk to the feeling part. Great work speaks clearly, while more trivial work does what critics call &#x201c;going dead.&#x201d; The experienced art collector will take a work home before buying it, to look at it several times a day. The question is whether a week or a month hence, after the novelty disappears, the message and painter&#x2019;s skill will still be apparent.<br><br>Dealer prices for the work shown by Saatchi ranged from $30,000 to $600,000. For the 105 pieces the total was about $7.8 million. Saatchi probably paid half that, because he is a high profile collector, and because the work was to be shown in a prestigious museum. Display at the Royal Academy would likely double the original retail value of each work, in which case the paper profit to Saatchi from the show was about $11.7 million. Saatchi is thought to have contributed about �2 million to pay for mounting the show.<br><br>So what was the significance of<i> USA Today</i>? Did the show reflect the reality of twenty-first century contemporary art, or just Charles Saatchi&#x2019;s preference for shock art? Did these works deserve to be shown in a major museum, in some cases only weeks after they were created? Jerry Saltz of the <i>Village Voice</i> offers a rule of thumb: 85 percent of new contemporary art is bad. Most of the art world agree with the percentage, but disagree on how any particular work should be ranked.<br><br>As an economist and contemporary art collector, I have long been puzzled by what makes a particular work of art valuable, and by what alchemy it is seen as worth $12 million or $100 million rather than say, $250,000. Works sometimes sell for a hundred times what seems a reasonable sum, but why? Dealers and auction house specialists do not claim to be able to identify or define what will become million-dollar contemporary art. They say publicly that prices are whatever someone will pay, and privately that art buying at the most expensive end is often a game played by the super-rich, with publicity and cultural distinction as the prize. That may be a good description of motivation, but it does not explain the process.<br>* This and prices that follow in the book are quoted in the currency of the original transaction. As a rough average over the periods involved, assume that $1.00 equals &#x20ac;.77 or �.55.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>4th of July</h2><p>After losing one of its own, Lindsay Boxer and the Women&#39;s Murder Club make a courageous return for their fourth and most chilling case ever--one that could easily be their last.

A Rough Riders book. Chassie West Glanzer hasn&#39;t been a stranger to drama and tragedy. A year of wedded bliss to sexy-as-sin cowboy Trevor Glanzer has brought her the happiness and contentment she never thought she&#39;d find, and mellowed Trevor&#39;s rodeo wanderlust. Then Trevors old roping partner ambles up the driveway and Chassie&#39;s life changes drastically. Trevor never expected to see Edgard Mancuso again, after it became clear he couldn&#39;t be the man Edgard needed. Now Edgard is back from Brazil to sort out their tangled past, and Trevor is plagued with feelings he thought he&#39;d buried over three years ago. Although Trevor is hat-over-bootheels in love with his sweet, feisty wife, the sense his life is missing a piece has always gnawed at him. Chassie&#39;s shock that Edgard and Trevor were once lovers turns to fear of losing her husband. Or worse, fear that Trevor will stay with her only out of a sense of duty. Yet as the three of them spend time together, the sins of the past blur and fade, leaving raw emotion and unbridled passion. Passion that could heal-or cause irreparable damage to their future.

And as she watches the <i>babushkas</i> of the village delight in their grandchildren, she longs for a grandchild of her own.<br><br>Then she has an idea: She will be a <i>babushka</i> instead of a Baba Yaga. She dresses herself up as a kindly grandmother and enters the village. When she comes across a young woman and her grandmotherless son, they adopt her as their very own <i>babushka</i>, and as the days pass, Baba Yaga and the boy, Victor, grow to love each other very much.<br><br>Until one day, Victor hears stories of the horrible, wicked Baba Yaga, and she knows that she must go back to the woods before the child finds out who she really is.<br><br>Legend would have Baba Yaga evil and unkind, but in Patricia Polacco's version of this Russian folktale, enlivened by her rich, vibrant art, we are reminded to judge not by rumor and appearance, but by what we know in our own hearts to be true.</p><p><b>Patricia Polacco&nbsp;</b>(www.patriciapolacco.com) is the beloved&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestselling author and illustrator of over fifty picture books.

Grateful for what teachers have done for her, she is also a popular keynote speaker celebrating teachers everywhere. She lives in Union City, Michigan, where she enjoys speaking to the myriad children who come to visit her and the famous meteor, the object of one of Patricia's best-known stories.Kindergarten-Grade 3-Wishing to be like the people she watches from the woods, Baba Yaga dresses herself in human clothing and covers her elfin ears with a scarf. Resembling any other grandmother or babushka, she is welcomed into the home of a young mother and quickly assumes the care of a child named Victor. She grows to love the boy, but when the other old women tell terrifying stories of the witch Baba Yaga, she returns to the woods with a heavy heart. Missing her, Victor wanders into the woods and is threatened by ferocious wolves. Coming to his rescue, Baba Yaga is finally accepted by the babushkas who realize that, "Those who judge one another on what they hear or see, and not what they know of them in their hearts, are fools indeed!" Polacco's reassuring text is accompanied by her full-page illustrations drawn in a casual, relaxed style in a variety of mediums: markers, charcoal pencil, chalk pastel, and gouache. The underlying message of tolerance is well presented, and the author does an admirable job of melding the two contrasting grandmother images from Russian culture. While her depiction of the misunderstood creature may surprise serious students of folklore, those wanting to share a kinder, gentler Baba Yaga will welcome this picture book.<br><i>Denise Anton Wright, Illinois State University, Normal</i><br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Art of Brush Lettering: A Stroke-by-Stroke Guide to the Practice and Techniques of Creative Lettering and Calligraphy</h2><p><b>A complete guide to brush pen lettering,&nbsp;<i>The Art of Brush Lettering</i>&nbsp;takes a meditative approach to creating beautiful letterforms, plus freestyle&nbsp;lettering, faux calligraphy, and special effects.</b><br><br> Instagram brush lettering artist Kelly Klapstein (@kellycreates) takes a simple, serene approach to teaching the art of creating beautiful letterforms with <b>easy-to-use and richly colored</b> brush pens.

In <i>Empires of Light</i>, historian Jill Jonnes portrays this extraordinary trio and their riveting and ruthless world of cutting-edge science, invention, intrigue, money, death, and hard-eyed Wall Street millionaires. At the heart of the story are Thomas Alva Edison, the nation&#x2019;s most famous and folksy inventor, creator of the incandescent light bulb and mastermind of the world&#x2019;s first direct current electrical light networks; the Serbian wizard of invention Nikola Tesla, elegant, highly eccentric, a dreamer who revolutionized the generation and delivery of electricity; and the charismatic George Westinghouse, Pittsburgh inventor and tough corporate entrepreneur, an industrial idealist who in the era of gaslight imagined a world powered by cheap and plentiful electricity and worked heart and soul to create it. <br><br>Edison struggled to introduce his radical new direct current (DC) technology into the hurly-burly of New York City as Tesla and Westinghouse challenged his dominance with their alternating current (AC), thus setting the stage for one of the eeriest feuds in American corporate history, the War of the Electric Currents. The battlegrounds: Wall Street, the 1893 Chicago World&#x2019;s Fair, Niagara Falls, and, finally, the death chamber&#x2014;Jonnes takes us on the tense walk down a prison hallway and into the sunlit room where William Kemmler, convicted ax murderer, became the first man to die in the electric chair. <br><br><i>Empires of Light</i> is the gripping history of electricity, the &#x201c;mysterious fluid,&#x201d; and how the fateful collision of Edison, Tesla, and Westinghouse left the world utterly transformed.</p><p>Jill Jonnes's compelling <i>Empires of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, and the Race to Electrify the World</i> offers a multi-sided tale of America's turn-of-the-20th-century quest for cheap, reliable electrical power. Along the way, the book profiles key personalities in both the science and industry of electrification and dramatizes the transformation of American society that accompanied the technological revolution. As her sub-title suggests, Jonnes's focus is on the three great personalities behind the building of the electricity industry. But, as she makes clear, the electrification of America was much more than a pathbreaking scientific quest. The genius of such poet-scientists as Nikola Tesla depended on the more finely tuned business skills of George Westinghouse and the towering capital of J.P. Morgan to achieve actualization. And even Thomas Edison and Westinghouse--innovative industrial combatants in the war between AC and DC current--were victims of the far more powerful and conservative financial forces of Wall Street. Indeed, for Jonnes, the story of electricity is as much about the legions of patent attorneys and bankers who controlled the flow of industry as it is about the circulation of current. Her sophisticated portrait of Gilded Age science, business, and society brings new light to the forces that underlie technological revolutions. As she reveals, it is not so much the great public men of science who directed the destiny of America's eventual empire of light; rather, the path was solidified by those men behind the scenes who were wise enough (and perhaps ruthless enough) to impose their legal, financial, and political dominance onto the scientific innovation--a valuable message for all eras. <i>--Patrick O&#x2019;Kelley</i>"[<b>Empires of Light</b><i> </i>is] a very accessible and informative historical account that will be fascinating reading for a general audience as well as those with a more specialized interest." -<i>Booklist<br></i><b>"</b>Empires of Light<b><i> </i>is a thoroughly engaging and highly informative account of three inventors who pioneered the production and distribution of electricity.

From the electrification of J. P. Morgan's New York mansion to Westinghouse's subjugation of Niagara Falls, Jonnes explains in human terms how alternating current achieved dominance over direct current, a victory of incalculable importance in the history of the world&#x2013;and she tells the story with great, at times even macabre, verve, as in her account of the invention of the electric chair and its horrifying first use.

The book is also a personal account of his own transformation from devout believer to passionate opponent of communism. His reminiscences about major thinkers he has knownJohn Dewey, Bertrand Russell, M. J. Adler, Einstein, and Sartre among othersare always revealing and make fascinating reading. Highly recommended.

He's a thoughtful craftsman, brick by brick laying the foundation for works that transcend continents and labels.

Zambra&#x2019;s characters, who have many of the same personal habits (smoking, listening to &#x2019;80s pop) and secret predilections (writing poetry, experimenting sexually), seem part of a big, fragmented novel. Through 11 stories, the author&#x2019;s charming cast examines religion, soccer, relationships, and the lure of solitude all from a distinctly Chilean perspective.

When a former congressional aide becomes part of the staff of the governor of a small Southern state, he watches in horror, admiration, and amazement, as the governor mixes calculation and sincerity in his not-so-above-board campaign for the presidency.</p><p>The famous -- or infamous -- roman a clef about the 1992 Clinton presidential campaign. You've read the hype; now read the book. <p> <b>Primary Colors</b> has its rich rewards as a savvy insider's look at life on the stump. But it travels far beyond mere gossip and expose and discovers a convincing world of its own, peopled by smart cookies, nutcases, and wheeler-dealers, whose public and private lives illuminate each other -- sometimes by casting dark shadows. This story spans the novelistic spectrum from bedroom farce to high moral drama, and it paints a picture of the political state of the nation so vivid and authentic that one finds in it the deepest kind of truth -- the kind of truth that only fiction can tell.</p>Already, the movie everyone is talking about:<p>"An audience at a test screening . . . gave the film very high marks.

Although Borges is celebrated for certain stories, certain poems, certain essays, even for certain words and phrases, these are all facets of an unmistakable whole, the Borges whom many consider to be the writer of our time. This book includes a number of earlier pieces never before translated, some of them not collected even in Spanish, and moves, as Borges moved, through his more fantastic work to a later realism. Besides the commentary, which sets the pieces in the context of Borges&#39;s writing life, the book has a bio-bibliography, and notes on all the pieces chosen, which point out to the reader the web of interconnections and recurring themes woven by Borges&#39;s work. The essential one-volume Borges, this book is an unequaied introduction to the work of the master.</p><p>Text: English, Spanish (translation)</p><h2>Color Index: Over 1100 Color Combinations, CMYK and RGB Formulas, for Print and Web Media</h2><p><b>Discover all the lessons and insights that a lifetime of painting provides!</b><br><br>The best way to learn something is with a great teacher.

It was a new and more sinister version of the old Great Game, with world domination as its ultimate aim. As the storm clouds of the First World War loomed, German hawks dreamed of driving the British out of India and creating a vast new Teutonic empire in the East, using their Turkish ally as a springboard. At the same time, Turkey&#39;s leaders aimed to free the Muslim peoples of Central Asia from the Tsarist yoke - and rule them themselves as part of a great new Ottoman empire. The shadowy - and often bloody - struggle that followed was fought out between the intelligence services of King, Kaiser, Sultan, and Tsar. It was to spill over into Persia, Afghanistan, the Caucasus, and Central Asia, and to be felt as far afield as the United States and China. Here, told in epic detail and for the first time, is the extraordinary story of the Turco-German jihad of the First World War, recounted through the adventures and misadventures of the secret agents and others who took part in it. Pieced together from the secret intelligence reports of the day and the long-forgotten memoirs of the participants, Peter Hopkirk&#39;s latest narrative is an enthralling sequel to the acclaimed The Great Game, and his three earlier works set in Central Asia. It is also highly topical in view of recent events in this volatile region where the Great Game has never really ceased. The rise of Islamic fundamentalism and fears of a resurgent Russia and a reunified Germany add greatly to thesignificance of this epic tale.<br>PETER HOPKIRK, a former reporter for the <em>Times</em> of London, has written several books about adventures in Central Asia, including <em>The Great Game</em>, <em>Setting the East Ablaze</em>, and <em>Trespassers on the Roof of the World</em>, all available from Kodansha Globe.<br></p><h2>A FAREWELL TO ARMS.</h2><p>DIFFERENT OFFER (this item listed here is DIFFERENT from the title and/or picture above.

The farm is located on the urban edge, between Martinez, Orinda, Pinole, and Richmond. It produces grapes for wine, olives for oil and curing, and summer vegetables, including the best-tasting Cherokee Purple heirloom tomatoes in the world. On two hillside pastures Powers raises goats, sheep, llamas, and emus. Many of the animals are retired or rescued farm animals, but the sheep and goats have become another business element of the ranch.<br><br> Alhambra Valley was once filled with orchards and wine grapes before Prohibition (1919 to 1933), with such well-known farmers as John Muir and John Swett. Powers started his farm in 1998 and since 1999 has planted hundreds of backyard vineyards in Contra Costa and surrounding counties under the name of Diablo Vineyard Planting and Management. In 2005 he revived the historic grape-growing and wine-making tradition by starting a small commercial winery on his farm. His varietal wines and blends are sold directly to friends, neighbors, stores, and restaurants.<br><br> He has also added more farm products and processing activities, including a greenhouse operation so that he can get his prize Cherokee Purple tomatoes to market in May instead of July.<br><br> These activities constitute the fourth or fifth career for this former attorney, county supervisor, realtor, and consultant. However, Powers is from a long line of farmers, including his grandfather who started one of the first farms in the Imperial Valley in 1910.<br><br> Tom Powers was awarded Contra Costa County&#x2019;s Sustainable Farming Individual of the Year award in 2009. In addition to the ranch, he runs the Alhambra Valley Olive Oil Company and Alhambra Valley Wine Company and chairs the Brentwood Agricultural Land Trust Board and the Contra Costa County Agricultural Advisory Board.</p></p><h2>How Wide the Divide?: A Mormon &amp; an Evangelical in Conversation</h2><p>Voted one of <em>Christianity Today's</em> 1998 Books of the Year! Mormons and evangelicals don't often get along very well, at least not once they begin to discuss their religious beliefs. They often set about trying to convert one another, considering the faith the other holds as defective in some critical way. Unfortunately, much of what they say about one another simply isn't true. False stereotypes abound on both sides, preventing genuine and helpful communication. Having discovered this sad state of affairs, Craig Blomberg, a committed evangelical scholar, and Stephen Robinson, a committed Mormon scholar, set out to listen to one another and to ferret out the real agreements and disagreements between them. In the conversation that develops, you will read what each believes about key theological issues--the nature and bounds of Scripture, the nature of God and deification, the person of Christ and the Trinity, and the essentials of salvation--and see how they interact with one another. What they agree on may surprise you. Though this book does not sweep differences under the rug, it is meant to help Mormons and evangelicals know and tell the truth about one another. It does not expect to end evangelistic efforts from either side. In fact, it may help to promote more effective communication because it can help to get rid of misrepresentations from both sides. In the end, however, you will be able to judge for yourself just how wide the divide between them is.</p><p>Craig L.

On the occasion of Emerson's 200th birthday, Lawrence Buell revisits the life of the nation's first public intellectual and discovers how he became a "representative man." </p><p> Born into the age of inspired amateurism that emerged from the ruins of pre-revolutionary political, religious, and cultural institutions, Emerson took up the challenge of thinking about the role of the United States alone and in the world. With characteristic authority and grace, Buell conveys both the style and substance of Emerson's accomplishment--in his conception of America as the transplantation of Englishness into the new world, and in his prodigious work as writer, religious thinker, and philosopher. Here we see clearly the paradoxical key to his success, the fierce insistence on independence that acted so magnetically upon all around him. Steeped in Emerson's writings, and in the life and lore of the America of his day, Buell's book is as individual--and as compelling--as its subject. At a time when Americans and non-Americans alike are struggling to understand what this country is, and what it is about, <i>Emerson</i> gives us an answer in the figure of this representative American, an American for all, and for all times. </p></p><p>Lawrence Buell is Powell M.

Howe (<i>Common-Place</i> 2003-10-01)</p><h2>Justice for Hedgehogs</h2><p>The fox knows many things, the Greeks said, but the hedgehog knows one big thing. In his most comprehensive work, Ronald Dworkin argues that value in all its forms is one big thing: that what truth is, life means, morality requires, and justice demands are different aspects of the same large question. He develops original theories on a great variety of issues very rarely considered in the same book: moral skepticism, literary, artistic, and historical interpretation, free will, ancient moral theory, being good and living well, liberty, equality, and law among many other topics. What we think about any one of these must stand up, eventually, to any argument we find compelling about the rest.<br>Skepticism in all its forms&#x2014;philosophical, cynical, or post-modern&#x2014;threatens that unity. The Galilean revolution once made the theological world of value safe for science. But the new republic gradually became a new empire: the modern philosophers inflated the methods of physics into a totalitarian theory of everything. They invaded and occupied all the honorifics&#x2014;reality, truth, fact, ground, meaning, knowledge, and being&#x2014;and dictated the terms on which other bodies of thought might aspire to them, and skepticism has been the inevitable result. We need a new revolution. We must make the world of science safe for value.</p><p>Ronald Dworkin was Frank Henry Sommer Professor of Law and Philosophy at New York University.His masterwork. (Samuel Moyn <i>The Nation</i> 2013-10-15)<br><br>In a sustained, profound, and richly textured argument that will, from now on, be essential to all debate on the matter, Ronald Dworkin makes the case for...the unity of value... Dworkin writes as an applied philosopher; the topics he discusses are matters of practical importance. They affect whether and how people can give meaning to their lives. They make a difference in legislatures and courts of law whose decisions touch hundreds of millions of lives. That is what gives the overall argument its urgency, for Dworkin's principal aim in establishing the unity of value is the familiar and central one for him: to show how law and government can be based on political morality... He completes, in [the] final chapter, a chain of reasoning that can be seen as uniting convictions of personal morality with principles of political justice, and then showing how these are all gathered together in a larger system of moral ideals that he believes lawyers and judges must deploy in discovering what the abstract principles of the American Constitution really mean and require. We are in at the birth, here, of a modern philosophical classic, one of the essential works of contemporary thought. It is bound to be a major debate-changer, because even the many who will find much to disagree with&#x2014;Dworkin, after all, disagrees with them in advance, and robustly&#x2014;will not be able to ignore the challenges he poses. And out of the heat to come, much light will shine. (A. C. Grayling <i>New York Review of Books</i> 2011-04-28)<br><br>The most profound legal book of the season is <i>Justice for Hedgehogs</i>... This book is [Dworkin's] theory of everything and rests on the notion that 'value' is the one big philosophical thing... For the first time, all pieces of Dworkin's jurisprudential thinking fall formidably into place. (Richard Susskind <i>The Times</i> 2011-08-03)<br><br>[Dworkin's arguments] display great intellectual rigour... A daring and demanding treatise... Defining morality as the standards governing how we ought to treat other people, and ethics as the standards governing how we ought to live ourselves, Dworkin argues that living morally and living ethically are inseparable. What we achieve is less important than the manner in which we live our lives, and that is judged in part by how we treat other people. To live well, Dworkin writes, is to live one's life as if it were a work of art. In a work of art the value of what is created is inseparable from the act of creating it. A painting is not only a product; it embodies a particular performance. For Dworkin, it isn't the product value of a human life that is most important but its performance value. A life should be an achievement 'in itself, with its own value in the art in living it displays.' ...<i>Justice for Hedgehogs</i> attempts to give human beings their due, not in any spirit of self-congratulation but so that we may build a better life for all. (Richard King <i>The Australian</i> 2011-03-26)<br><br><i>Justice for Hedgehogs</i> represents a powerful account of what our moral world would have to be for our moral life to be harmonious. (William A. Galston <i>Commonweal</i> 2011-07-15)<br><br>The 79-year-old professor of philosophy's grand, perhaps culminating, statement of what truth is, what life means, what morality requires and justice demands... [Dworkin] builds up a comprehensive system of value&#x2014;embracing democracy, justice, political obligation, morality, liberty, equality&#x2014;from his notions of dignity and self-respect. (Stuart Jeffries <i>The Guardian</i> 2011-04-01)<br><br>The first thing to strike you about this remarkable book is its ambition... In <i>Justice for Hedgehogs</i> all of Dworkin's great talent is on display, the themes overwhelming in their sheer bigness. The basic point is that like the hedgehog in a famous essay by Isaiah Berlin, there is one big thing Dworkin knows above all else&#x2014;it is what makes sense of how we act as persons, how we relate to others and how we construct our society... The nineteen substantive chapters stand as a great statement of a life well lived (and with, it is hoped, many years still to go). (Conor Gearty <i>New Humanist</i> 2011-03-01)<br><br><i>Justice for Hedgehogs</i> is Dworkin's most ambitious book to date... It is full of sustained argument and arresting observations drawn from a lifetime of thought and a great armory of knowledge.

Until, that is, over a year ago, when a climbing accident left him paraplegic. Now he spends his time in the backyard of his brownstone in Boston, with only his dog and his teen-aged son Ethan for company. <br><br> Brady Coyne, Walt's long-time friend and attorney, handles his routine legal affairs and is asked by Walt to deliver a set of Meriweather Lewis letters to a rare book dealer for authentication. Shortly after, responding to a call from Duffy, Coyne stops by after work only to find Walt dead - murdered - in his backyard. Robbery is dismissed as a motive when the only thing that turns up missing is Walt's laptop. Equally disturbing is the fact that Ethan, Walt's son, is missing without a trace, any sign of struggle, or any clue to where he may have gone. There is also evidence that Walt was somehow involved in a notorious eco-terrorist group that is currently taking deadly action around the Boston area.<br><br> With the FBI and the Boston police watching him closely, the eco-terrorists escalating dramatically, and Ethan still missing, Brady finds himself in the center of an increasingly dangerous plot. With the death toll mounting, Brady realizes he has to find the missing Ethan and unravel the complex puzzle before either of them becomes the latest victim.<br></p><p>Walter Duffy was the world's leading bird photographer until an accident crippled him. So Boston lawyer Brady Coyne, an old friend, makes a point of visiting him in his bird-filled garden terrace--until the day Brady finds him lying next to his crutches, fatally bashed in the back of the head. Was it an accident or murder? Where is Walter's college-age son, who was also his much abused household helper? Who keeps calling Brady at odd hours, tipping him off to upcoming arson fires? And what's it all got to do with a packet of letters allegedly written by Meriwether Lewis?<p> This is Brady Coyne's 19th solo outing, and fans will find their hero just as likable, even-tempered, and incorruptible as ever. They'll also appreciate his growing relationship with companion Eve Banyon (who may be unrealistically gorgeous and devoted, but whose presence gives rise to one of the best sex-in-a-thunderstorm scenes you'll read this year). The suspense in <i>A Fine Line</i> is on the mild side, and the slightly disconnected plot concludes with a too-neat wrap-up. But you'll still enjoy reading Tapply for his fully fleshed people, his evocation of Boston, and his lean prose, which--as always--goes down as smoothly as 16-year-old single malt. <i>--Nicholas H. Allison</i></p>Brady Coyne Is Feeling The Heat.<br><br>Walt Duffy spent his life traveling the world, documenting the beauty and wonder of nature through the lens of a camera. But there was nothing natural about the ugly way he died, his skull fractured by an unknown assailant, his broken body left sprawled right in his own backyard. The irony wasn't lost on Boston attorney Brady Coyne. He first met Duffy while handling his divorce a decade earlier, and their relationship evolved into a working friendship. He knew Duffy well, or so Brady thought. That belief is about to be put to the test when Coyne is brought in for questioning by both the local police and the FBI, who reveal Duffy's ties to a notorious ecoterrorist group that is currently setting fires to homes and offices around the Boston area. And when Brady begins to get mysterious calls in the middle of the night, warning of the next fire to be set, he knows that he has become an unwilling pawn in a chess game with the deadliest of consequences.<br><br>"Tapply consistently delivers well-written, well-constructed and thoroughly entertaining mysteries, and his latest is no exception." -<i>Publishers Weekly</i> (starred review) <br><br>"Brady is as easygoing as ever, an amiable guide through a credible cast of suspects." -<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br></p><h2>A Murder in Wartime: The Untold Spy Story That Changed the Course of the Vietnam War</h2><p>A look at the greatest unsolved mystery and political coverup of the Vietnam War describes how, in 1969, eight Green Berets in Vietnam were arrested for the murder of a Vietnamese agent working for the Vietcong, even though it had been ordered by the CIA.</p><p>A tale of intrigue between the CIA and the Green Berets during the Vietnam War, by the author of The Vietnam Fact Book (1987 paperback). In 1969, a captured photograph suggested that a Vietnamese employed by the Green Berets as an agent, one Thai Khac Chuyen, was actually a North Vietnamese soldier. Chuyen was involved in the gathering of intelligence to support the Nixon Administration's recently begun secret bombings of Cambodia. Green Beret operatives pulled him in, determined that he was compromised, and went to the CIA for instructions--which were, off the record, to kill Chuyen. The operatives asked for official confirmation, but it was late in coming, so, with the approval of the Green Beret commander, Col. Robert Rheault, the operatives shot Chuyen and dumped the body at sea. Then an official communication arrived from the CIA not to proceed, followed by an investigation by the Army and then a media blitz and a ``show trial'' of eight Green Berets in the US. The trial was quickly shut down because of its embarrassment to the Green Berets and to the Nixon Administration's secret conduct of the war. Stein, an Army intelligence officer at the time, is able to tell the full story because of the Official Secrets Act, which declassified relevant documents. He has interviewed the principals and here dramatizes their roles as a novelist might; he lays out clearly the convoluted chronology. What emerges is a high-minded Green Beret command sullied by covert operations, and an eternally sleazy CIA running death squads through its Phoenix program. Well done, and of historical interest because the trial prompted Daniel Ellsberg's leak of The Pentagon Papers to The New York Times, heralding both the end of the war and of the Nixon Administration. (Twenty-four pages of photographs and maps--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>In June 1969 a group of Green Beret officers, suspecting that one of their Vietnamese operatives was a double agent, executed him and dropped his weighted body into the ocean off Nha Trang. A dogged investigation by two Army detectives led to their arrest, followed by a hearing to determine whether they would face court-martial. The admitted triggerman, Capt. Robert Marasco, defended the group's action by stating that eliminating Thai Khac Chuyen was no different than eliminating a Vietcong during a search-and-destroy mission. Gen. Creighton Abrams, commander of U.S. forces in Vietnam, didn't see it that way; neither did Army Secretary Stanley Resor. When the case became a cause celebre in the States, however, most Americans viewed the arrests as evidence of the high-level politicking that had hamstrung our troops from the start. In the end the Army dropped the charges, but the "Green Beret case" nevertheless had a significant effect on the conduct of the war: it provoked Daniel Ellsberg to leak the Pentagon Papers. In this skillfully told, engrossing narrative, Stein ( The Vietnam Fact Book ) presents all sides of this controversial case, a veritable metaphor for the ambiguities of the Vietnam War.

Mr. Kessler lives in Potomac, Maryland.</p>Kessler ( Escape from the CIA ), who is the first journalist to be accorded the full cooperation of the CIA, here reveals more about the agency's structure, policies and key personnel than any previous writer has. He defines the missions of the agency's five components--the director and the directorates of operations, science and technology, intelligence, and administration. Kessler explores such diverse subjects as the agency's employment policies (the CIA, he maintains, prefers aggressive, manipulative recruits willing to lie and to break the laws of foreign countries), the director's daily presidential briefing, the CIA's counter-narcotics efforts, the physical plant itself ("The CIA compound is indeed a spooky place") and the agency's struggle to create a viable public-relations policy. As to the agency's mandate, given the diminution of the Soviet threat, Kessler reports that the CIA is intensifying its effort to track nuclear proliferation, international drug trafficking and terrorism.

Today, many believe that the war was fought over slavery. This answer satisfies our contemporary sense of justice, but as Gary Gallagher shows in this brilliant revisionist history, it is an anachronistic judgment.</p><p> </p><p> In a searing analysis of the Civil War North as revealed in contemporary letters, diaries, and documents, Gallagher demonstrates that what motivated the North to go to war and persist in an increasingly bloody effort was primarily preservation of the Union. Devotion to the Union bonded nineteenth-century Americans in the North and West against a slaveholding aristocracy in the South and a Europe that seemed destined for oligarchy. Northerners believed they were fighting to save the republic, and with it the world&#x2019;s best hope for democracy.</p><p> </p><p> Once we understand the centrality of union, we can in turn appreciate the force that made northern victory possible: the citizen-soldier. Gallagher reveals how the massive volunteer army of the North fought to confirm American exceptionalism by salvaging the Union. Contemporary concerns have distorted the reality of nineteenth-century Americans, who embraced emancipation primarily to punish secessionists and remove slavery as a future threat to union&#x2014;goals that emerged in the process of war. As Gallagher recovers why and how the Civil War was fought, we gain a more honest understanding of why and how it was won.</p></p><p>Gary W. Gallagher is John L. Nau III Professor of History at the University of Virginia.Gary Gallagher, more carefully and precisely than anyone else, enables the reader to understand why so many citizen soldiers were willing to peril their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor to preserve the United States as one nation, indivisible and, in Lincoln's words at Gettysburg, to give the "new nation" brought forth in 1776 a "new birth of freedom" in 1863. (James M. McPherson, author of <i>Battle Cry of Freedom</i>)<br><br><i>The Union War</i>reaffirms Gary Gallagher's reputation as one of the most astute and provocative writers on the American Civil War. This work places the Union at the heart of the war but also argues for the central role of armies and soldiers in understanding how the goals of reunion and emancipation were finally realized. With clarity and verve, Gallagher deals with large questions in an unfailingly profound way. (George C. Rable, author of <i>God's Almost Chosen Peoples</i>)<br><br>Gary Gallagher has written another gem in <i>The Union War</i>. A companion to his brilliant and controversial The Confederate War, this slender volume is sure to generate wide readership and debate. (Joseph T. Glatthaar, author of <i>General Lee's Army: From Victory to Defeat</i>)<br><br>A rare volume that forces us to reconsider how we think about the Civil War. Examining historic actors in the context of their own time and place, Gallagher reminds of the centrality of "Union" as the motivating force driving the Northern cause, and the significance of those citizen-soldiers who joined the Union Army in determining the results. (Matthew Gallman, author of <i>Northerners at War: Reflections on the Civil War Home Front</i>)<br><br>Brimming with insights, eloquent in argument, and filled with new evidence from the men who fought for the Union, this revisionist history will cause readers to rethink many of the now-standard Civil War interpretations. An essential work. (Randall M. Miller <i>Library Journal (starred review)</i> 2011-03-01)<br><br>This exceptionally fine book is in effect a companion piece to its author's <i>The Confederate War</i>, published in 1997... Now, in <i>The Union War</i>, Gallagher is back to take issue with what has become the new conventional wisdom, that the North fought the war in order to achieve the emancipation of the slaves. While welcoming the post-civil-rights-era emphasis on "slavery, emancipation, and the actions of black people, unfairly marginalized for decades in writings about the conflict," Gallagher makes a very strong case--in my view a virtually irrefutable one--that the overriding motive in the North was preservation of the Union...Gallagher, who holds a distinguished professorship in history at the University of Virginia, is far more interested in pursuing historical truth than in massaging whatever praiseworthy sentiments he may harbor on race, gender, class or anything else. He knows that for the historian the central obligation is to understand and interpret the past, not to judge it. This is what he has done, to exemplary effect, in <i>The Union War</i>. I suspect that one of his motives in writing it may have been to remind us of what a precious thing our Union is, a Union that we have come to take for granted. Fighting for its preservation was a noble thing, in and of itself. (Jonathan Yardley <i>Washington Post</i> 2011-04-15)<br><br>Gary Gallagher, a Civil War historian at the University of Virginia, aims to recover an antebellum understanding of the Civil War. In his new book, <i>The Union War</i>, Gallagher argues that Northerners actually went to war to support the abstract idea of "Union"--a political idea, he writes, whose "meaning has been almost completely effaced" from our modern political consciousness. (Josh Rothman <i>Boston Globe blog</i> 2011-04-19)<br><br>In <i>The Union War</i>, Gallagher offers not so much a history of wartime patriotism as a series of meditations on the meaning of the Union to Northerners, the role of slavery in the conflict and how historians have interpreted (and in his view misinterpreted) these matters...At a time when only half the population bothers to vote and many Americans hold their elected representatives in contempt, Gallagher offers a salutary reminder of the power of democratic ideals not simply to Northerners in the era of the Civil War, but also to people in other nations, who celebrated the Union victory as a harbinger of greater rights for themselves. Imaginatively invoking sources neglected by other scholars--wartime songs, patriotic images on mailing envelopes and in illustrated publications, and regimental histories written during and immediately after the conflict--Gallagher gives a dramatic portrait of the power of wartime nationalism. (Eric Foner <i>New York Times Book Review</i> 2011-05-01)<br><br>While mindful of slavery's complex and deleterious role in fomenting disunion, Gallagher emphasizes the centrality of Northerners' devotion to the idea of the Union of their grandparents and their parents...Historians who stress emancipation over Union, Gallagher insists, miss the realities of antebellum inequalities based on class, gender and race...Gallagher's great contribution lies in contextualizing and underscoring the broad meaning of the Union, and later emancipation, to Northerners. (John David Smith <i>News &amp; Observer</i> 2011-05-22)<br><br>Gallagher, one of the nation's preeminent Civil War scholars and a professor at the University of Virginia, deals in his latest book of the question of why did the North fight? His answer is in the volume's first sentence: The loyal American citizenry fought a war for Union that also killed slavery. This fast-paced review of the controversies that civil war historians have been arguing about is opinionated, well-informed, provocative and just the thing any American history buff needs to read this spring as our country gears up for the sesquicentennial of the conflict that made the United States begin to live up to the Declaration's words that "all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights."

What we may not realize is that the United States was born out of debt. After the Revolution, the brilliant Alexander Hamilton was less interested in paying down the Revolutionary war debt than in using it to create a vibrant national economy. "If it is not excessive," he declared, "a national debt will be to us a national blessing." In a fascinating narrative brimming with colorful characters, historical accidents, and American ingenuity, business historian John Steele Gordon leads us on a tour of an American institution whose largely unknown story has been integrally entwined with our country's destiny. At key points in U.S. history, Gordon shows how the national debt has been a potent instrument of fiscal policy in keeping the world safe for democracy. But how much debt is too much? At a time when we despair of balancing even a single year's budget, Hamilton's Blessing provides much needed perspective - and hope. * Author writes the "Business of America" column in American Heritage magazine and is heard often on public radio's "Marketplace."</p></p><p>Over the past couple of decades, our national debt has become a favorite political football for Democrats and Republicans alike. Yet few Americans seem aware that the debt has a long and (mostly) honorable history. Alexander Hamilton considered it a kind of political Krazy Glue, which would also spur American industry by keeping taxes high. This borrowing power enabled the North to win the Civil War without wrecking its economy and rescued us from the Great Depression. John Steele Gordon doesn&#39;t deny the dangers of an entire nation living on credit; indeed, he believes that our fiscal affairs are a mess. But he puts this mess in fascinating perspective. And he&#39;s quick to see the human side of economic behavior: &#34;One problem,&#34; he writes, &#34;is that human nature predisposes us to recognize depression easily and quickly, but prosperity, like happiness, is most easily seen in retrospect.&#34; Bull&#39;s-eye!John Steele Gordon is one of America's leading historians, specializing in business and financial history. A full-time writer for the last nineteen years, Gordon's articles have been published in, among others, Forbes, Forbes FYI, Worth, The New York Times Book Review, The New York Times's and The Wall Street Journal's Op-Ed pages, and The Washington Post's Book World and Outlook.

They were critics of authority (both secular and religious) and champions of social justice who left their poetry on tree trunks and rocks. They were also reportedly monastics, drunks, cave dwellers, immortals, and many other wild and wondrous things. There is much delightful uncertainty about this "Laughing Pair"--including whether or not they actually existed. What is known is that the poetry attributed to them was greatly influential in both China and Japan, and to the Beat writers in the United States during the 1950s and '60s.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acclaimed manga creator Sean Michael Wilson has brought these renegade poets to life, showing the places they went and the philosophical and meditative aspects of their lives, as well as revealing their humor and wackiness and their penetrating insights into the human condition.Their poetry is interwoven throughout--translations by J.

She was an accidental journalist, yet from the beginning, her writings reflected the warmth, wit, and keen human interest that readers would come to love in her fiction.

She began working for <i>The</i> <i>Irish Times</i> beginning in the early 1960s, and she wrote regularly for the newspaper in the decades that followed, including a weekly column that won her the hearts and minds of readers. Married to Gordon Snell, she lived in Dalkey, Ireland, until her death in July 2012.<br> &nbsp;<br> www.maevebinchy.com<p>Pageantry and Splendour at Westminster for the Royal Wedding&nbsp; 15 November 1973<br><br> The ushers were simply delighted to see me.<br><br> &#x2018;Splendid,&#x2019; they said, &#x2018;absolutely splendid. Let&#x2019;s have a little look. Oh, yes, seat number 17 this way. Super view, and just beside the telly, too. Super!&#x2019; They could have been brothers of my dearest friend, instead of members of Mark Phillips&#x2019; regiment examining the press ticket, which had cost �23.<br><br> Westminster Abbey was lit up like an operating theatre; the light from the chandeliers was only like candlelight compared to the television lights. Well, since 500 million people, including the Irish, were meant to be looking in, I suppose you had to have it bright enough to see something. There was plenty to see from the top of a scaffolding over the north transept. Grace Kelly staring into space, looking like she always looked, kind of immaculate.<br><br> Rainier has aged a bit oddly and looks like Marlon Brando in <i>The Godfather</i>. Harold Wilson, all smiles and straightening his tie, his wife looking as if she were about to compose the final poem on the occasion. Jeremy Thorpe was all giggles and jauntiness, Heath looked like a waxwork.<br><br> Anthony Barber looked suitably preoccupied, as well he might, with a State-of-Emergency going on outside the Abbey doors, and Whitelaw looked as if it was his first day off in two years. There were a lot of people whose faces I thought I knew, but it was no help asking for advice on either side. The man from the <i>Manchester Evening News </i>seemed to be writing an extended version of <i>War and Peace </i>in a notebook and on my right an agency reporter was transcribing a file of cuttings.<br><br> And then the royals started to arrive. We could see them on the television set &#x2013; which was six inches from me &#x2013; leaving Buckingham Palace in their chariots, and like characters stepping out of a film, they suddenly turned up a hundred feet below our seats. The Queen Mother looked the way she has ever looked &#x2013; aged 56 and benign. The Queen looked thin and unhappy in a harsh blue outfit. Princess Margaret looked like a lighting devil with a cross face and an extraordinary hideous coat, which may have been some multi- coloured fur. But then was there ever an animal or even a selection of animals that would have been given such a coat by Nature.<br><br>The Phillips&#x2019; parents looked sick with nerves; nobody in the place was hating it as much as they were. Mother Phillips nearly tore her gloves to shreds, father Phillips let his invitation fall and it struck me as odd that the groom&#x2019;s parents should have had to carry an invitation at all. The son and heir stood smiling and resplendent in scarlet, dimpling and smiling, and you felt that if all else failed and he doesn&#x2019;t become a brigadier or something in six months, he will have a great living in toothpaste commercials.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>The Dean of Westminster, who is a very civilised, cheerful sort of man, was sort of happy about it all, and so was the Archbishop of Canterbury. They beamed all round them and extracted a few return grins from the nervous-looking lot in the VIP seats. The choirboys looked suitably angelic and uncomfortable in their ruffs. One of them got his fingers caught behind his neck and had to have it released.<br><br>The trumpeters were noble and rallying, and the Beefeaters were traditionally beefy. Everything was as it should be in fact, as we waited for the bride.<br><br>About three seconds after the glass coach had left Buckingham Palace with Anne and her father we were all handed two pages of strictly embargoed details about the wedding dress: it would have threatened national security to have had it before, apparently. Journalists all around me were devouring it and rewriting the details of seed pearls and 1,000 threads of 20-denier silk to every inch of the garment. When she arrived at the door of the Abbey there was a bit of excitement about arranging the train and adjusting the tiara, and the bride looked as edgy as if it were the Badminton Horse Trials and she was waiting for the bell to gallop off.<br><br>Up at the altar all the royals looked out as eagerly and anxiously as if they thought the Duke of Edinburgh and his only daughter might have dropped off for a pint on the way. The Queen actually smiled when they got into sight and Mark gave a matinee-idol shy, rueful smile. Princess Margaret read her programme of the wedding service as if it were the latest Agatha Christie that she had promised to finish before lunchtime.<br><br>The Duke of Edinburgh went and sat beside his wife and mother- in-law and seemed to have a far greater control over his sword than did Prince Charles, who carried his as if it were an umbrella. I was waiting for half his relatives to have their legs amputated but there must have been some kind of plastic top on it because nobody seemed to be maimed or anything when they were leaving.<br><br>The service went as planned and the young voices were clear and loud, as everyone remarked approvingly afterwards, no coyness or nervous stutters. There were a lot of hymns, and I saw the Queen singing her head off, but gloomily, and the Phillips parents sang, too, nervously on their side.<br><br>Then off they galloped down the aisle and it was over. And do I mean over! There was no hooley in the palace or anything; the party had been on Monday night. The people who had got all dressed up went home, I suppose. The bridal couple had about nine hours of photographs, and all the people who had been camping on the street packed their spirit stoves into plastic bags and went off for lunch.<br><br>It was a superbly organised show, with all the actors playing their parts perfectly, timing and all. Everyone who had a role kept to it: the Duchess of Kent looked sweet and pure English girlhood; Princess Alexandra managed to give the odd vaguely tomboyish grin which she thinks is expected. The Duke of Edinburgh and Lord Snowdon looked as self-effacing as Mark Phillips is beginning to look already. The ushers saw us out, thrilled that we had been able to get there and hoping earnestly that we had a good view of everything. The evening papers were already on the streets with early photographs. &#x2018;The Snow White Princess!&#x2019; screamed one headline, as if the readers had expected the bride to wear scarlet jodhpurs.<br><br>It was a very well-produced show, no one could deny that, but then the actors are getting slightly above Equity rates.<br> &nbsp;<br> Excerpted from <b>Maeve&#x2019;s Times </b>by Maeve Binchy.

The book is like a dream you want to last forever. . . . It glows with the radiance and resilience of the human spirit.<br><br>Like his much praised novel The Emigrants (1996), this new work by Sebald is steeped in melancholy. Its also highly idiosyncratic, beginning as the record of a fictional walking tour along the coast of Suffolk in southeast England before turning into a broad, rich meditation on Britains past and the power of history. Observations en route link with psychological and historical elements to form a kind of dreamscape, the boundaries of which become increasingly hard to define, though the 17th-century naturalist and physician Thomas Browne acts as fixed point of reference. The walk starts at the remains of the fairy-tale palace known as Somerleyton Hall, once a extravagance. On the nearby coastline are other ruins, from the recently foundered town of Lowestoft (where Joseph Conrad first made landfall in England), a wreck after the Thatcherite bubble burst, to the more spectacular ghost of the once-mighty port of Dunwich, which over several centuries toppled inexorably into the North Sea. Each of the sites prompts stories of Britains past. A railway bridge, for instance, leads to the story of the odd train that once ran over it and of the trains unlikely connection with the Emperor of China and the silk trade. Turning inland, the trail leads to writer Michael Hamburger (a number of writers, most long dead, figure in the journey), whose story of flight from the Nazis in recent history, and on to a disorienting sandstorm among the remains of a forest uprooted by the freak hurricane of 1987 before turning back to the history of Britains colonial involvement in the silk trade, which binds many threads of this trek together. Erudition of this sort is too rare in American fiction, but thehypnotic appeal here has as much to do with Sebalds deft portrait of the subtle, complex relations between individual experience and the rich human firmament that gives it meaning as it does with his remarkable mastery of history.<br><br>In August 1992, W.G.

His work has been translated into ten languages, and in 2002 he received the Literature Award of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He lives in Vermont.As recounted by Bobrick, Russia's conquest of far-flung Siberia is a magnificent saga that rivals that of the settlement of the American West in its tragic drama. Lured by the prospect of a lucrative fur trade, small bands of Russians, convinced of their right to dispossess "inferior" peoples, subjugated Turkish and Mongol nomads, fueled intertribal warfare and destroyed native cultures through forced assimilation. Colonization sparked riots and populist uprisings in the 16th century. Modern times brought further disruption. The Trans-Siberian Railway, completed in 1901, enabled millions of peasants to migrate over the Urals. Under Lenin, shamans and other Siberian natives were annihilated. Stalin stepped up the collectivization of Siberian agriculture, causing famine and massacres. Possession of this resource-rich yet economically deprived region makes Russia today "potentially the richest nation on earth," writes Bobrich, biographer of Ivan the Terrible. He fills his narrative with descriptions of reckless Cossacks, polygamous Aleuts, Buddhist Buryats, explorers, exiles and Gulag prisoners.

That time has come in this eleventh entertaining cozy featuring the cookie baker: she must go on a diet. Hannah starts working out at a health club and vows to stop tasting the scrumptious treats she prepares every day for the Cookie Jar bakery in Lake Eden, Minnesota. Stress mounts when Hannah discovers the body of a fitness instructor floating in her club&#x2019;s Jacuzzi. The acerbic trainer was universally loathed by women and liked by most men (including the staff of the local police department) for her flirtatious ways. In a reversal of the usual procedure, this time one of Hannah&#x2019;s boyfriends, Detective Mike Kingston, recruits her help in solving the mystery, as he and his fellow cops are potential suspects.

The photographs of different structures, both modern and ancient, by Cynthia Wright, create a breathtaking glimpse into a building technique that is as old as human history, but exactly suitable for today&#39;s resource-conscious and environmentally friendly building needs. Trees may be getting a bit scarce these days, but there&#39;s no current shortage of dirt, the main component of rammed earth homes.

After consuming far more than my share of that frontier delicacy Monongahela rye, a calm resolution had come over me. A very angry man named Nathan Dorland was looking for me, asking for me at every inn, chophouse, and tavern in the city and making no secret of his intention to murder me. Perhaps he would find me tonight and, if not, tomorrow or the next day. Not any later than that. It was inevitable only because I was determined not to fight against the tide of popular<br><br>opinion&#x2014;which is to say, that I ought to be killed. It was my decision to submit, and I have long believed in keeping true to a plan once it has been cast in earnest.<br><br>It is a principle I cultivated during the war&#x2014;indeed, one I learned from observing General Washington himself. This was in the early days of the Revolution, when His Excellency still believed he might defeat the British in pitched battle, Continental style, with our ill- disciplined and badly equipped militias set against the might of British regulars. It was the decisive military victory he wanted; indeed, in those early days it was the only sort he believed worth having. He would invite the officers to dine with him, and we would drink claret and eat roast chicken and sip our turtle soup and he would tell us how we were going to drive the Redcoats back at Brooklyn, and the unfortunate affair would be over before winter.<br><br>That was during the war. Now it was early in 1792, and I sat at the bar of the Lion and Bell in that part of Philadelphia euphemistically called Helltown. In that unsavory scene, I drank my whiskey with hot water while I waited for death to find me. I kept my back to the door, having no wish to see my enemy coming and because the Lion and Bell was as unlovely a place as Helltown offered&#x2014;and those were mighty unlovely. The air was thick with smoke from pipes plugged full of cheap tobacco, and the floor, naught but dirt, had turned to mud with the icy rain outside and the spills and spitting and tobacco juice. The benches lay lopsided in the newly made hummocks and ruts of the ground, and the drunken patrons would, from time to time, topple over and tumble like felled timber into the muck. Perhaps a drinker might take the trouble to roll a friend over to keep him from drowning, though there could be no certainty. Helltown friends were none the best.<br><br>It was a curious mix there: the poor, the whores, the desperate, the servants run off for the night or the month or forever. And alongside them, throwing dice upon uneven surfaces or hunched over a hand of cards spread across ripped velvet, were the gentlemen in their fine woolen suits and white stockings and shimmering silver buckles. They&#x2019;d come to gawk and to rub elbows with the colorful filth, and most of all they&#x2019;d come to game. It was the spirit of the city, now that Alexander Hamilton, that astonishing buffoon, had launched his great project, the Bank of the United States. As Secretary of the Treasury, he had single-handedly transformed the country from a republican beacon for mankind into a paradise for speculators. Ten years earlier, with a single stroke, he had transformed me from patriot to outcast.<br><br>I removed from my pocket a watch, currently my only possession of value if one did not account my slave, Leonidas. I had, despite the decisions that had prevailed among the wise drafters of our Constitution, never quite learned to think of Leonidas as property. He was a man, and as good a man as any I&#x2019;d known. It sat ill with me to keep a slave, particularly in a city like Philadelphia, whose small population of owned blacks numbered in the dozens, and one could find fifty free blacks for each bondsman. I could never sell Leonidas, no matter how dire my need, because I did not think it right to buy and sell men. On the other hand, though it was no fault of his, Leonidas would fetch at auction as much as fifty or sixty pounds&#x2019; worth of dollars, and it had always seemed to me madness to emancipate such a sum.<br><br>So the timepiece, in practical terms, was currently my only thing of worth&#x2014;a sad fact, given that I had removed it from its rightful owner only a few hours earlier. Its glittering face told me it was now half past eight. Dorland would have eaten his fashionably late dinner well over two hours ago, giving him ample time to collect his friends and come in search of me. It could be any minute now.<br><br>I slid back into my pocket the timepiece I&#x2019;d taken on Chestnut Street. The owner had been a fat jackanapes, a self-important merchant. He&#x2019;d been talking to another fat jackanapes and had paid no mind while I brushed past him. I&#x2019;d not planned to take the watch, nor did I make a habit of such things as common theft, but it had been so tempting, and there seemed to be no reason not to claim it and then disappear in that crowded street, clacking with the walking sticks of bankers and brokers and merchants. I saw the watch, saw it might be taken, and saw how I might take it.<br><br>Even then, if that had been all, I would have let it go, but then I heard the man speak. It was his words, not my need, that drove me to take what was not mine. This man, this lump of a man, who resembled a great and corpulent bottom-heavy bear, forced into a crushed-velvet blue suit, had been invited to a gathering the next week at the house of Mr. William Bingham. That was all I knew of him, that he, a mere maker of money, nothing more than a glorified storekeeper, had been invited to partake of the finest society in Philadelphia&#x2014;indeed, in the nation. I, who had sacrificed all for the Revolution, a man who had risked life in return for less than nothing, was little more than a beggar. So I took his watch, and I defy anyone to blame me.<br><br>Now that it was mine, I examined the painting in the inside cover, a young lady of not twenty, plump of face, like the watch&#x2019;s owner, with a bundle of yellow hair and eyes far apart and open wide, as though she&#x2019;d been in perpetual astonishment while she sat for the portrait. A daughter? A wife? It hardly mattered. I had taken from a stranger a thing he loved, and now Nathan Dorland was coming to avenge such wrongs, too innumerable to catalogue.<br><br>&#x201c;Handsome timepiece,&#x201d; said Owen, standing behind the bar. He was a tall man with a head long and narrow, shaped like one of the pewter mugs into which he poured his ales, with wheat-colored hair that curled up like foam. &#x201c;Timepiece like that might go a way toward paying a debt.&#x201d; He held out one of his meaty hands, covered with oil and filth and blood from a fresh cut on his palm to which he paid no mind.<br><br>I shrugged. &#x201c;With all my heart, but you must know the watch is newly thieved.&#x201d;<br><br>He withdrew the hand and wiped it on his filthy apron. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t need the trouble, but I ought to send you to fence it now, before you lose it at game.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Should I turn the watch to ready, I would not use it for something so ephemeral as a tavern debt.&#x201d; I pushed my empty mug toward him. &#x201c;Another, if you please, my good man.&#x201d;<br><br>Owen stared for a moment, his tankard of a face collapsed in purse- lipped indecision. He was a young man, not two-and-twenty, and he had a profound, nearly religious reverence for those who had fought in the war. Living, as he did, in such a place as Helltown, and moving through indifferent social circles, he had never heard how my military career had met its conclusion, and I saw no advantage in sharing information that would lead to his disillusionment.<br><br>Instead, I favored other details. Owen&#x2019;s father died in the fighting at Brooklyn Heights, and more than once had I treated Owen to the tale of how I had met his father that bloody day, when I was captain of a New York regiment, before my true skills were discovered and I was no longer to be found upon the battlefield. That day I led men, and when I told Owen the tale, my voice grew thick with cannon fire and death screams and the wet crunch of British bayonet against patriot flesh. I would recount how I had given Owen&#x2019;s honored father powder during the chaos of the ignominious retreat. With blood and limbs and musket balls flying about us, the air acrid with smoke, the British slaughtering us with imperial fury, I had taken the time to aid a militia volunteer, for we had shared a moment of revolutionary comradeship that defied our differences in rank and station. The tale kept the drinks flowing.<br><br>Owen took my mug, poured in some whiskey from an unstoppered bottle and hot water from a pitcher near the stove. He set it down before me with a considerable thud.<br><br>&#x201c;Some would say you&#x2019;ve had your fill,&#x201d; he told me.<br><br>&#x201c;Some would,&#x201d; I agreed.<br><br>&#x201c;Some would say you&#x2019;re abusing my generosity.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Impertinent bastards.&#x201d;<br><br>Owen turned away and I opened the watch once more, setting it upon the counter, where I might stare at the tick of its hands and the girl who had meant so much to the merchant. To my right sat an animated skeleton of a man in a ragged coat that covered remarkably unclean linen. His face was unshaved, and his nasty eyes, lodged between the thinning brown hair of his crown and the thickening brown hair of his cheeks, stole glances at my prize. I&#x2019;d seen him come in an hour earlier and slide a few coins across the bar to Owen, who had, in exchange, handed a small parchment sack to the ragged man. Owen did a brisk trade in that greenish powder called Spanish fly, though this man, his magic dust in hand, seemed content to sit at the bar and cast glances at me and my timepiece.<br><br>&#x201c;I say, fellow, you are looking upon my watch.&#x201d;<br><br>He shook his head. &#x201c;Wasn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why, I saw it, fellow. I saw you setting larcenous eyes upon my watch. This very one.&#x201d;<br><br>...</p><h2>The Short Drop (Gibson Vaughn)</h2><p><p><b>The bestseller with over half a million readers that <i>People</i> magazine called a &#x201c;live-wire debut.&#x201d;</b></p><p>A decade ago, fourteen-year-old Suzanne Lombard, the daughter of Benjamin Lombard&#x2014;then a senator, now a powerful vice president running for the presidency&#x2014;disappeared in the most sensational missing-person case in the nation&#x2019;s history.

His answer ("Ah, but they have") is elaborated in painful detail in this autobiography. Agee, a CIA operations officer from 1957 to 1968, resigned in disgust over the agency's connection with political repression in South America and wrote Inside the Company: CIA Diary, an expose that caused an international uproar, the echoes of which still reverberate. Here he recounts how he came to join the CIA, his growing disenchantment, the influence of the Cuban revolution on his decision to write Inside the Company and his anxiety-filled life of harassment and exile ever since. Charges that the agency has attempted to discredit himaccusing him of being a traitor, a drunk, a womanizer, a mental caseare backed up with details. It is an ugly story filled with emotion and suspense, and Agee makes no bones about his continued obsession with exposing questionable CIA activities and personnel. His U.S. passport revoked in 1979, Agee now lives in West Germany. 30,000 first printing; major ad/promo. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.Agee, author of Inside the Company: CIA Diary (1975) and other books exposing and denouncing the Central Intelligence Agency, his former employer, has written a political autobiography detailing his life after leaving the Agency. Now living (somewhat surprisingly) in West Germany, Agee has been expelled from five NATO countries and had his U.S. passport revoked in 1979. In return, he has been relentless in his anti-CIA crusade and his revelations were largely responsible for the law that makes it a crime to publish names of undercover CIA agents. With the flavor of both a spy thriller and an anti-imperialist polemic, On the Run is timely and will appeal to the audience that read his earlier books. Recommended. Gregor A.

These spirits have a great deal to say about what they have learned and discovered on the other side and how we, the living, can benefit from their experiences.</p><p><em>Unfinished Business</em> is filled with shocking and emotional stories of Van Praagh's communication with loved ones who cross over the barrier between the living and the dead to send messages to those whom they have left behind. Through these pro-found true stories, Van Praagh guides us on an adventure into the spirit world. The lessons for the living that he has learned from these experiences range from the dangers of emotional baggage caused by guilt, fear, and regret to the importance of karma, forgiveness, and taking responsibility for our actions. Van Praagh shares with us now the wisdom that, without him, we would only gain after death.</p><p>Van Praagh writes: </p><p>"When people shed their physical bodies at death, their spiritual selves see life from a whole new perspective. It's as if they had Lasik surgery. They can finally take off their glasses and see everything more clearly. </p><p>"Spirits understand why certain situations had to happen. They are able to recognize the value of others, even their enemies, and what they had to learn from them. They also realize how they could have skipped certain mistakes by not letting their egos get in the way. After crossing into the light, spirits are ever eager to share their newfound knowledge with the living, and I am fortunate to be a beneficiary of spirits' wisdom and guidance, and I am happy to share their insights with you."</p><p><strong>JAMES VAN PRAAGH</strong> is the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>Unfinished Business</em>, <em>Ghosts Among Us</em>, and <em>Talking to Heaven</em>.

For twenty-five years they lived and worked in creative harmony, she writing, he painting. They reconvened from separate studios for quiet lunches--talk was reserved for dinner--and walks down to the stream or up the nearby hill to pick blueberries. "We ate in the shade of the arbor and danced under the starry skylight of the studio," Nancy wrote in Creature to Creature, a collaborative work of poems and sketches. Though Russell died many years ago, the house today still suggests his presence--his crisp landscape paintings decorate the walls, and his photograph adorns the bedroom. Wistfulness flickers and vanishes as Nancy speaks of the past, and the atmosphere of the property, depending on the clouds overhead and the wafting of warm breezes, ranges from melancholic to romantic to euphoric, like the restored stone silo, open to the sky: on gray days it towers to the heavens like a medieval ruin; on sunny days it's a fairy-tale leaf-strewn changing area for the nearby pool.<br><br>The house itself is stucco-covered stone, built in the 1820s by an affluent Englishman, no doubt in the manor style of his home county, with two pointed Gothic windows high on either side. The front facade is blunt and classical, with two rows of evenly spaced ordinary windows and a paved path leading directly to the door. (In 1839 the house--including 100 acres--sold for $250.) When Russell bought the place in 1940, he made few changes to the exterior; he patched up holes and added a lintel, a pineapple flanked on either side by two round balls, made of carved wood covered in stucco.<br><br>Off the back of the house sits what had been the original owner's manger for livestock, with an enclosed hayloft above. Exposed on one side, with two doors on the facing wall, the lower space feels both sheltered and airy, the darkness lit up by sunlight on the green fields beyond. Russell and Nancy paved the earth floor and installed a grill for cooking, but the feel of the place, with its stone walls and coarse timber ceiling, is still marvelously primitive, even a bit brutish. With smoke, snow, and "an imported shaggy pony, Nancy's son, Jan Egleson, a film director, turned it into a sixteenth century Irish manor hall for a television series several years ago. Stacked logs line one wall, and huge stone slabs step up into the main house. As boys, Nancy's sons slept in the large whitewashed loft above the garden room, and the whole family still gathers here for meals and to celebrate birthdays, anniversaries, and other happy occasions. A thirty-year-old trumpet vine frames the view toward the stream and hill, and the fragrance of alyssum and twining roses drifting from Nancy's gray-green garden sweetly suggests the summer nights when, as Nancy wrote, "eating by candlelight, in the breezeway that once housed sheep and cows, we talked the hours away."</p><h2>Imitation Of Christ</h2><p>After the Bible, The Imitation is the all-time favorite book of Catholics for over 500 years. And this translation of Bishop Challoner, who revised the Douay-Rheims Bible in the 1740&#39;s, is the most beautiful and edifying we know of. Speaks to the soul of every Christian, reminding him of the shortness of time, the length of eternity and the brevity of earthly joy vs. the eternity of happiness with God. Belongs in every Catholic&#39;s library. Impr. 427 pgs, PB</p><p>The Thomas � Kempis fan club includes St. Ignatius, Thomas Merton, Thomas More, and even Agatha Christie's Miss Marple. (She reads a chapter of <i>The Imitation of Christ</i> every night before sleep.) <i>Imitation</i> has exerted immense influence on Christian worship, ethics, and church structure, because it gives specific yet broad-minded guidance about the central task of Christian life--learning to live like Jesus. Better to read this book a little here and there, now and then, than to try gobbling it cover to cover. <i>Imitation</i> is no triumph of orderly thinking, but it's a great monument and incentive to deep living. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>When does a classic become new, fresh and extremely relevant? When someone takes it out of an outdated format and makes it readable, searchable and understandable. The Imitation of Christ has been in print for over 500 years for a good reason. It is powerful, beautiful and heart piercing. James Watkins has taken those words and reworked them into ninety daily readings, arranged by topic. Whether for daily devotions or for sound insight into a particular issue, Watkins paraphrase blends the ancient with the modern to introduce this classic to a new audience, speaking to all Christians with credibility and authority and using inclusive language not found in the original.</p><h2>The Paley&#39;s Place Cookbook: Recipes and Stories from the Pacific Northwest</h2><p>Nestled in a converted Victorian in Portland's trendy Northwest District, Paley's Place Bistro and Bar has been serving Vitaly Paley's creative, beautifully executed cooking for over a decade.

But Renfrew also opens up to discussion, and even debate, the term &#x201c;prehistory&#x201d; itself, giving an incisive, concise, and lively survey of the past, and how scholars and scientists labor to bring it to light. <br><br>Renfrew begins by looking at prehistory as a discipline, particularly how developments of the past century and a half&#x2013;advances in archaeology and geology; Darwin&#x2019;s ideas of evolution; discoveries of artifacts and fossil evidence of our human ancestors; and even more enlightened museum and collection curatorship&#x2013;have fueled continuous growth in our knowledge of prehistory. He details how breakthroughs such as radiocarbon dating and DNA analysis have helped us to define humankind&#x2019;s past&#x2013;how things have changed&#x2013;much more clearly than was possible just a half century ago. Answers for why things have changed, however, continue to elude us, so Renfrew discusses some of the issues and challenges past and present that confront the study of prehistory and its investigators. <br><br>In the book&#x2019;s second part, Renfrew shifts the narrative focus, offering a summary of human prehistory from early hominids to the rise of literate civilization that is refreshingly free from conventional wisdom and grand &#x201c;unified&#x201d; theories. The author&#x2019;s own case studies encompass a vast geographical and chronological range&#x2013;the Orkney Islands, the Balkans, the Indus Valley, Peru, Ireland, and China&#x2013;and help to explain the formation and development of agriculture and centralized societies. He concludes with a fascinating chapter on early writing systems, &#x201c;From Prehistory to History.&#x201d; <br><br>In this invaluable, brief account of human development prior to the last four millennia, Colin Renfrew delivers a meticulously researched and passionately argued chronicle about our life on earth, and our ongoing quest to understand it.</p><p>Colin Renfrew was professor of archaeology from 1981 to 2004, at Cambridge University where he is now a Fellow of the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research. Also a Fellow of the British Academy, he has won numerous international medals and prizes and was made a life peer in 1991. A leading figure in archaeology worldwide, he is known for his work on the radiocarbon revolution, the prehistory of language, archaeogenetics, and the prevention of looting on archaeological sites. He has led many excavations, especially in Greece. He is co-author, with Paul Bahn, of <i>Archaeology: Theories, Methods, and Practice</i>, the definitive student reference.Chapter 1. The Idea of Prehistory<br> &nbsp;<br> When Dr. Johnson asserted, &#x201c;All that is really known of the ancient state of Britain is contained in a few pages,&#x201d; he was right. At that time, knowledge of the past was based upon the study of existing historical texts.<br> &nbsp;<br> Two centuries ago, prehistory did not exist. Not only was there no discipline devoted to the study of prehistoric times&#x2014;the study that we today call prehistoric archaeology. More serious, the very notion of prehistory, in the sense of a broad stretch of time going back before the dawn of written history, had not been formulated. There was absolutely no notion that the human past involved tens of thousands of years of development and change. In Europe many scholars followed the arguments of the seventeenth-century cleric and biblical scholar Archbishop Ussher, who had calculated that the earth was created in the year 4004 b.c.e. This, to us extraordinary, claim was based upon his calculations using the generations of men set out in the Old Testament of the Bible. The other episodes of the biblical narrative could be seen to follow, making a coherent and self-consistent story. If the world had been created in 4004 b.c.e., it followed clearly that any notion of prehistory was superfluous, a concept almost unimaginable in the face of biblical scholarship.<br> &nbsp;<br> Many of the great literary traditions, whether in Europe, Western Asia, India, or China, had likewise no place for any such notion of deep time, going back tens of thousands of years. Indeed, most human cultures, most societies, are founded upon and incorporate a view of the world involving a system of basic beliefs, related to the prevailing religious tenets and observances, that explain how the world came to be. In Europe that system of beliefs meant Christianity, whether Catholic, Orthodox, or Protestant. In Western Asia it generally meant the faith of Islam. In both those cases, as with the Jewish faith, and indeed with many religions, the doctrine of faith involves a creation story, a creation myth. The creation myth generally sets out how the world began, and how the human species came to be, often through the agency of the primary creative force itself. For believers of a monotheist faith, that force was God. And for the &#x201c;sons of Abraham&#x201d; (Jews, Christians, and Muslims) that belief was set out in the Book of Genesis in the Old Testament of the Bible. The creation of the world in six days (culminating in the creation of man on the sixth, prior to the day of rest) established the historical context for any consideration of ancient things.<br> &nbsp;<br> The very notion of prehistory could be formulated only after the development of those new ways of thought that we associate with&nbsp;the Enlightenment, and indeed with the scientific revolution seen in other areas of research. Prominent among those was astronomy, where the studies (and above all the observations) of Galileo and Copernicus created a new and revolutionary worldview. But, as we shall see, developments in other disciplines, including geology and natural history, formed a key part of the background of thought in front of which the notion of prehistory could emerge and develop.<br> &nbsp;<br> To understand what is meant by prehistory today, what we believe when we contemplate the deep human past, it is important to see that this is a relatively new study, and one that is changing rapidly in the face of new research techniques and new ideas about human development and change. For instance the development of DNA studies for the reconstruction of human descent lines has had a profound effect upon the way we look at our place in the world today.<br> &nbsp;<br> The first great realization in the nineteenth century, which opened the way to the serious study of prehistory, was the establishment of the sheer antiquity of humankind.<br> &nbsp;<br> Before Prehistory<br> &nbsp;<br> The very idea of prehistory could not develop until it was realized that written historical texts were not the only possible source of information about the past, as Dr. Johnson had assumed. In the early days of archaeology, the excavations made in ancient cities and cemeteries were used to illustrate what was already known from the historical texts. Indeed, it can be argued that the birth of archaeology owes much to the passions of the great collectors, the princes and cardinals of Renaissance Italy, and the European monarchs who followed them in collecting classical statuary&#x2014;&#x201c;antique marbles,&#x201d; as they were called. Charles I, when he came to the throne of England in 1625, &#x201c;amply testified a Royall liking of ancient statues, by causing a whole army of Old forraine Emperors, Captaines and Senators all at once to land on his coasts, to come and do him homage, and attend him in his palaces of Saint James and Sommerset house.&#x201d; Half a century later Louis XIV sought to import to France, to decorate his great palace at Versailles, &#x201c;tout ce qu&#x2019;il a de beau en Italie.&#x201d; Noblemen embarked on the grand tour and came back with trophy sculptures with which to decorate their stately homes. The practice of digging at ancient settlement sites for material evidence of the past was first developed to meet the tastes and desires of these early collectors.<br> &nbsp;<br> The discovery in the eighteenth century of the buried cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum, destroyed in the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 c.e., led to more energetic and ultimately more systematic excavations, and gradually digging was established as a means of obtaining information as well as marbles and other antiquities for the cabinet of the collector. The desire to illuminate and extend the picture offered by the written texts encouraged excavation in Western Asia, where it was hoped that material evidence would be found to illustrate the Old Testament of the Bible. The excavation by Paul-�mile Botta at Nineveh in 1842 and then by Austen Henry Layard at Nimrud in 1845 marked the beginning of systematic archaeology in Mesopotamia. Before long the biblical texts that had inspired the excavations were being enhanced by the decipherment of the inscribed clay tablets found in those excavations. Egyptology and Assyriology thus had already developed systematic excavations on a large scale even before the notion of prehistory was formulated.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was in fact in northern Europe, where the material remains of literate early civilizations were less in evidence, that the monuments of a more remote past first attracted attention. In Britain, the great monument at Stonehenge was a subject for speculation, being assigned first to the Romans and then to the Danes and then again to the druids&#x2014;the local priests in Anglesey mentioned in the writings of Julius Caesar. One of the first antiquaries to undertake systematic excavations in England, in the burial mounds (the so-called barrows) of Wiltshire, was Sir Richard Colt Hoare, the proprietor of the mansion at Stourhead in that county. Prevented from undertaking the grand tour by the Napoleonic wars, he instead undertook a tour of Ireland in 1806. During it he visited the great stone-built passage grave of Newgrange (which today we recognize as a megalithic tomb of the neolithic period dating to around 3200 b.c.e.). He was impressed, but he was also puzzled. And he expressed his puzzlement in a splendid statement that indicates the frustration of a serious scholar before the concept of prehistory (and the techniques of prehistoric archaeology) had been formulated. He wrote:<br> &nbsp;<br> I shall not unnecessarily trespass upon the time and patience of my readers in endeavouring to ascertain what tribes first peopled this country; nor to what nation the construction of this singular monument may reasonably be attributed for, I fear, both its authors and its original destination will ever remain unknown. Conjecture may wonder over its wild and spacious domains but will never bring home with it either truth or conviction. Alike will the histories of those stupendous temples at AVEBURY and STONEHENGE which grace my native county, remain involved in obscurity and oblivion.</p><h2>Information Anxiety</h2><p>Information Anxiety offers a cure for the uneasiness most people feel daily as they&#39;re overwhelmed with facts and data pretending to be useful information. With simple, creative guidance, this book teaches readers how to learn what they want to learn from the media and other communication sources.</p><p>Information might want to be free; but, why should we free it? We've got enough trouble keeping track of all the petabits that already run around untethered, and risk a computer counterrevolution if we let the situation get much crazier. Information architect Richard Saul Wurman swept the field clear in 1989 with his groundbreaking book that foresaw the problems of data clutter and proposed a radical new means of organizing and presenting knowledge humanistically; for the new century, he has revised it substantially as <i>Information Anxiety 2</i>. This book is sparklingly clear and readable--it'd better be, after all--and offers insight not only to designers, educators, and content developers, but also to anyone who needs to communicate effectively through dense clouds of facts. If Wurman occasionally indulges in New Age-y pop psychology, his analysis is never muddy, and the more hardheaded reader will forgive him soon enough. The discussion alternates between describing the deeply stressful task of absorbing poorly organized data and exploring solutions that require a bit of rethinking, but that reward such an investment with improved understanding and, maybe, a state change from information to wisdom. We could do worse--if we don't pay attention to Wurman and his colleagues, we almost certainly will. <i>--Rob Lightner</i>A follow up to the first edition, Information Anxiety 2 teaches critical lessons for functioning in today&#39;s Information Age. In this new book, Wurman examines how the Internet, desktop computing, and advances in digital technology have not simply enhanced access to information, but in fact have changed the way we live and work. In examining the sources of information anxiety, Wurman takes an in-depth look at how technological advances can hinder understanding and influence how business is conducted.</p><h2>The Lost Prince (The Iron Fey, 5)</h2><p><strong>From the limitless imagination of </strong><strong><em>New York Times</em></strong><strong> and </strong><strong><em>USA Today </em></strong><strong>bestselling author Julie Kagawa, The Iron Fey series continues.<br><br>Don&#x2019;t look at Them.

I just wish I hadn't pulled so many people into this mess. They shouldn't have to suffer because of me. Especially...her. God, if I could take back anything in my life, I would never have shown her my world, the hidden world all around us. I <em>knew</em> better than to let her in. Once you see Them, they'll never leave you alone. They'll never let you go. Maybe if I'd been strong, she wouldn't be here with me as our seconds tick away, waiting to die.<br><br>It all started the day I transferred to a new school. Again.<br><br>The alarm clock went off at 6:00 a.m., but I had been awake for an hour, getting ready for another day in my weird, screwed-up life. I wish I was one of those guys who roll out of bed, throw on a shirt and are ready to go, but sadly, my life isn't that normal. For instance, today I'd filled the side pockets of my backpack with dried Saint-John's-wort and stuffed a canister of salt in with my pens and notebook. I'd also driven three nails into the heels of the new boots Mom had bought me for the semester. I wore an iron cross on a chain beneath my shirt, and just last summer I'd gotten my ears pierced with metal studs. Originally, I'd gotten a lip ring and an eyebrow bar, too, but Dad had thrown a roof-shaking fit when I came home like that, and the studs were the only things I'd been allowed to keep.<br><br>Sighing, I spared a quick glance at myself in the mirror, making sure I looked as unapproachable as possible. Sometimes, I catch Mom looking at me sadly, as if she wonders where her little boy went. I used to have curly brown hair like Dad, until I took a pair of scissors and hacked it into jagged, uneven spikes. I used to have bright blue eyes like Mom and, apparently, like my sister. But over the years, my eyes have become darker, changing to a smoky-blue-gray&#x2014;from constant glaring, Dad jokes. I never used to sleep with a knife under my mattress, salt around my windows, and a horseshoe over my door. I never used to be "brooding" and "hostile" and "impossible." I used to smile more, and laugh. I rarely do any of that now.<br><br>I know Mom worries about me. Dad says it's normal teenage rebellion, that I'm going through a "phase," and that I'll grow out of it. Sorry, Dad. But my life is far from normal. And I'm dealing with it the only way I know how.<br><br>"Ethan?" Mom's voice drifted into the room from beyond the door, soft and hesitant. "It's past six. Are you up?"<br><br>"I'm up." I grabbed my backpack and swung it over my white shirt, which was inside out, the tag poking up from the collar. Another small quirk my parents have gotten used to. "I'll be right out."<br><br>Grabbing my keys, I left my room with that familiar sense of resignation and dread stealing over me. <em>Okay, then. Let's get this day over with.</em><br><br>I have a weird family.<br><br>You'd never know it by looking at us. We seem perfectly normal; a nice American family living in a nice suburban neighborhood, with nice clean streets and nice neighbors on either side. Ten years ago we lived in the swamps, raising pigs. Ten years ago we were poor, backwater folk, and we were happy. That was before we moved into the city, before we joined civilization again. My dad didn't like it at first; he'd spent his whole life as a farmer. It was hard for him to adjust, but he did, eventually. Mom finally convinced him that we needed to be closer to people, that <em>I</em> needed to be closer to people, that the constant isolation was bad for me. That was what she told Dad, of course, but I knew the real reason. She was afraid. She was afraid of Them, that They would take me away again, that I would be kidnapped by faeries and taken into the Nevernever.<br><br>Yeah, I told you, my family is weird. And that's not even the worst of it.<br><br>Somewhere out there, I have a sister. A half sister I haven't seen in years, and not because she's busy or married or across the ocean in some other country.<br><br>No, it's because she's a queen. A faery queen, one of Them, and she can't ever come home.<br><br>Tell me <em>that's</em> not messed up.<br><br>Of course, I can't ever tell anyone. To normal humans, the fey world is hidden&#x2014;glamoured and invisible. Most people wouldn't see a goblin if it sauntered up and bit them on the nose. There are very few mortals cursed with the Sight, who can see faeries lurking in dark corners and under beds. Who know that the creepy feeling of being watched isn't just their imagination, and that the noises in the cellar or the attic aren't really the house settling.<br><br>Lucky me. I happen to be one of them.<br><br>My parents worry, of course, Mom especially. People already think I'm weird, dangerous, maybe a little crazy. Seeing faeries everywhere will do that to you. Because if the fey<br><br><em>know</em> you can see them, they tend to make your life a living hell. Last year, I was kicked out of school for setting fire to the library. What could I tell them? I was innocent because I was trying to escape a redcap motley that followed me in from the street? And that wasn't the first time the fey had gotten me into trouble. I was the "bad kid," the one the teachers spoke about in hushed voices, the quiet, dangerous kid whom everyone expected would end up on the evening news for some awful, shocking crime. Sometimes, it was infuriating. I didn't really care what they thought of me, but it was hard on Mom, so I tried to be good, futile as it was.<br><br>This semester, I'd be going to a new school, a new location. A place I could "start clean," but it wouldn't matter. As long as I could see the fey, they would never leave me alone. All I could do was protect myself and my family, and hope I wouldn't end up hurting anyone else.<br><br>Mom was at the kitchen table when I came out, waiting for me. Dad wasn't around. He worked the graveyard shift at UPS and often slept till the middle of the afternoon. Usually, I'd see him only at dinner and on weekends. That's not to say he was happily oblivious when it came to my life; Mom might know me better, but Dad had no problem doling out punishments if he thought I was slacking, or if Mom complained. I'd gotten one D in science two years ago, and it was the last bad grade I'd ever received.<br><br>"Big day," Mom greeted me as I tossed the backpack on the counter and opened the fridge, reaching for the orange juice. "Are you sure you know the way to your new school?"<br><br>I nodded. "I've got it set to my phone's GPS. It's not that far. I'll be fine."<br><br>She hesitated. I knew she didn't want me driving there alone, even though I'd worked my butt off saving up for a car. The rusty, gray-green pickup sitting next to Dad's truck in the driveway represented an entire summer of work&#x2014;flipping burgers, washing dishes, mopping up spilled drinks and food and vomit. It represented weekends spent working late, watching other kids my age hanging out, kissing girlfriends, tossing away money like it fell from the sky. I'd <em>earned</em> that truck, and I certainly wasn't going to take the freaking bus to school.<br><br>But because Mom was watching me with that sad, almost fearful look on her face, I sighed and muttered, "Do you want me to call you when I get there?"<br><br>"No, honey." Mom straightened, waving it off. "It's all right, you don't have to do that. Just...please be careful."<br><br>I heard the unspoken words in her voice. <em>Be careful of</em> Them. <em>Don't attract their attention. Don't let Them get you into trouble. Try to stay in school this time.</em><br><br>"I will."<br><br>She hovered a moment longer, then placed a quick peck on my cheek and wandered into the living room, pretending to be busy. I drained my juice, poured another glass, and opened the fridge to put the container back.<br><br>As I closed the door, a magnet slipped loose and pinged to the floor, and the note it was holding fluttered to the ground. <em>Kali demonstration, Sat.,</em> it read. I picked it up, and I let myself feel a tiny bit nervous. I'd started taking kali, a Filipino martial art, several years ago, to better protect myself from the things I knew were out there. I was drawn to kali because not only did it teach how to defend yourself empty-handed, it also taught stick, knife and sword work. And in a world of dagger-toting goblins and sword-wielding gentry, I wanted to be ready for anything. This weekend, our class was putting on a demonstration at a martial arts tournament, and I was part of the show.<br><br>If I could stay out of trouble that long, anyway. With me, it was always harder than it looked.<br>Starting a new school in the middle of the fall semester sucks.<br><br>I should know. I've done all this before. The struggle to find your locker, the curious stares in the hallway, the walk of shame to your desk in your new classroom, twenty or so pairs of eyes following you down the aisle.<br><br><em>Maybe third time's the charm,</em> I thought morosely, slumping into my seat, which, thankfully, was in the far corner. I felt the heat from two dozen stares on the top of my head and ignored them all. <em>Maybe this time I can make it through a semester without getting expelled. One more year&#x2014;just give me one more year and then I'm free.</em> At least the teacher didn't stand me up at the front of the room and introduce me to everyone; that would've been awkward. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why they thought such humiliation was necessary. It was hard enough to fit in without having a spotlight turned on you the first day.<br><br>Not that I'd be doing any "fitting in."<br><br>I continued to feel curious glances directed at my corner, and I concentrated on not looking up, not making eye contact with anyone. I heard people whispering and hunched down even more, studying the cover of my English book.<br><br>Something landed on my desk: a half sheet of notebook paper, folded into a square. I didn't look up, not wanting to know who'd lobbed it at me. Slipping it beneath the desk, I opened it in my lap and looked down.<br><br><em>U the guy who burned down his school?</em> it read in messy handwriting.<br><br>Sighing, I crumpled the note in my fist. So they'd already heard the rumors. Perfect. Apparently, I'd been in the local paper: a juvenile thug who was seen fleeing the scene of the crime. But because no one had actually <em>witnessed</em> me setting the library on fire, I was able to avoid being sent to jail. Barely.<br><br>I caught giggles and whispers somewhere to my right, and then another folded piece of paper hit my arm. Annoyed, I was going to trash the note without reading it this time, but curiosity got the better of me, and I peeked quickly.<br><br><em>Did u really knife that guy in Juvie?</em><br><br>"Mr. Chase."<br><br>Miss Singer was stalking down the aisle toward me, her severe expression making her face look pinched behind her glasses. Or maybe that was just the dark, tight bun pulling at her skin, causing her eyes to narrow. Her bracelets clinked as she extended her hand and waggled her fingers at me. Her tone was no-nonsense. "Let's have it, Mr. Chase."<br><br>I held up the note in two fingers, not looking at her. She snatched it from my hand. After a moment, she murmured, "See me after class."<br><br>Damn. Thirty minutes into a new semester and I was already in trouble. This didn't bode well for the rest of the year. I slumped farther, hunching my shoulders against all prying eyes, as Miss Singer returned to the front and continued the lesson.<br><br>I remained in my seat after class was dismissed, listening to the sounds of scraping chairs and shuffling bodies, bags being tossed over shoulders. Voices surged around me, students talking and laughing with each other, gelling into their own little groups. As they began to file out, I finally looked up, letting my gaze wander over the few still lingering. A blond boy with glasses stood at Miss Singer's desk, rambling on while she listened with calm amusement. From the eager, puppy-dog look in his eyes, it was clear he was either suffering from major infatuation or was gunning for teacher's pet.<br><br>A group of girls stood by the door, clustered like pigeons, cooing and giggling. I saw several of the guys staring at them as they left, hoping to catch their eye, only to be disappointed. I snorted softly. <em>Good luck with that.</em> At least three of the girls were blonde, slender and beautiful, and a couple wore extremely short skirts that gave a fantastic view of their long, tanned legs. This was obviously the school's pom squad, and guys like me&#x2014;or anyone who wasn't a jock or rich&#x2014;had no chance.<br><br>And then, one of the girls turned and looked right at me.<br><br>I glanced away, hoping that no one noticed. Cheerleaders, I'd discovered, usually dated large, overly protective football stars whose policy was punch first, ask questions later. I did not want to find myself pressed up against my locker or a bathroom stall on my first day, about to get my face smashed in, because I'd had the gall to look at the quarterback's girlfriend. I heard more whispers, imagined fingers pointed my way, and then a chorus of shocked squeaks and gasps reached my corner.<br><br>"She's really going to do it," someone hissed, and then footsteps padded across the room. One of the girls had broken away from the pack and was approaching me. Wonderful.<br><br><em>Go away,</em> I thought, shifting farther toward the wall. <em>I have nothing you want or need. I'm not here so you can prove that you're not scared of the tough new kid, and I do not want to get in a fight with your meathead boyfriend. Leave me alone.</em><br><br>"Hi."<br><br>Resigned, I turned and stared into the face of a girl.<br><br>She was shorter than the others, more perky and cute than graceful and beautiful. Her long, straight hair was inky-black, though she had dyed a few strands around her face a brilliant sapphire. She wore sneakers and dark jeans, tight enough to hug her slender legs, but not looking like she'd painted them on. Warm brown eyes peered down at me as she stood with her hands clasped behind her, shifting from foot to foot, as if it was impossible for her to stay still.<br><br></p><h2>Science 5 Student Activity Manual</h2><p>Science 5 teaches students to think about science in light of the Creation Mandate.

"Never before and in no other country," observes director Wim Wenders, "have images and language been abused so unscrupulously as here, never before and nowhere else have they been debased so deeply as vehicles to transmit lies." More than a thousand German feature films that premiered during the reign of National Socialism survive as mementoes of what many regard as film history's darkest hour.</p><p>As Eric Rentschler argues, however, cinema in the Third Reich emanated from a Ministry of Illusion and not from a Ministry of Fear. Party vehicles such as <i>Hitler Youth Quex</i> and anti-Semitic hate films such as <i>Jew S�ss</i> may warrant the epithet "Nazi propaganda," but they amount to a mere fraction of the productions from this era. The vast majority of the epoch's films seemed to be "unpolitical"--melodramas, biopix, and frothy entertainments set in cozy urbane surroundings, places where one rarely sees a swastika or hears a "Sieg Heil."</p><p>Minister of propaganda Joseph Goebbels, Rentschler shows, endeavored to maximize film's seductive potential, to cloak party priorities in alluring cinematic shapes. Hitler and Goebbels were master showmen enamored of their media images, the Third Reich was a grand production, the Second World War a continuing movie of the week. The Nazis were movie mad, and the Third Reich was movie made. Rentschler's analysis of the sophisticated media culture of this period demonstrates in an unprecedented way the potent and destructive powers of fascination and fantasy. Nazi feature films--both as entities that unreeled in moviehouses during the regime and as productions that continue to enjoy wide attention today--show that entertainment is often much more than innocent pleasure.</p></p><p>Eric Rentschler is Arthur Kingsley Porter Professor of Germanic Languages and Literatures at Harvard University.&#x201c;This massively documented study of Nazi cinema...notably succeeds in analysing how Nazi films created a dreamworld that seemed neither realistic nor fantastic, but agreeable and persuasive--indeed closer to Hollywood than to Stalinist cinema. Above all, [Rentschler] stresses how films belong to a German cultural continuum, reaching into the present. Fifty years after Siegfried Kracauer's landmark book <i>From Caligari to Hitler</i>, this is the study that's long been needed of the movies' most disturbing triumph.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Sight and Sound</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Fifty years after Kracauer's monumental <i>From Caligari to Hitler</i> comes the next installment of the story. Rentschler shows how German films were central to an administered popular culture. Goebbels' chilling, still-seductive cinema exemplifies the complex social role played by the mass media at the end of our century. Rentschler-one of America's finest scholars of German cinema-has given us a lucid, passionate book.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>David Bordwell, University of Wisconsin, author of The Cinema of Eisenstein</b><br><br>&#x201c;[A] quite exceptional new book...[Nazi cinema] is an issue which is, in fact, far more urgent, and more topical, than it may at first appear. The cinema of Hitler, far from perishing with the passing of the Third Reich, continues to thrive...One is grateful to Rentschler both for producing such a well-researched, thorough and thoughtful book, and for doing to with such constructive energy, fine style and subtle wit. Any serious student either of film or of the Third Reich will learn a great deal from this splendid new account.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Graham McCann</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[This is] an invaluable book of film history...Rentschler has actually watched the several hundred films made in Germany under the Third Reich, and he's the first to be able to talk authoritatively about their content and ideology.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Gerald Peary</b><b>, </b><b><i>Boston Phoenix</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The scope of Rentschler's argument and the thoroughness of his research--not to mention the elegance of his prose--will significantly change how we look at the cinema of the Third Reich...[This is] a passionate, nuanced, and highly readable book that contributes significantly to existing studies on Nazi cinema while remaining accessible to a general public interested in German history, cinema, and the study of mass media in general.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Gerd Gem�nden</b><b>, </b><b><i>German Quarterly</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The regime of Adolf Hitler was the world's 'first full-blown media dictatorship,' writes Eric Rentschler...[An] accomplished and engaging writer...Mr. Rentschler pays great...attention to the historical context of each film 'text.'&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>J.

Rather, the author provides measured, elegantly written assessments of several key films--such as the 'movement film' <i>Hitler Youth Quex</i>, the breezy, American-style <i>Lucky Kids</i>, Sirk's <i>La Habanera</i>,the notorious <i>Jew S�ss</i>, and the fantastic, still much beloved <i>M�nchhausen</i>--to explore recent claims of their alleged resistance to the Nazi regime and to examine reasons for their enduring popularity, at least in Germany. Rentschler avoids both pitfalls often associated with discussions of these films--reductive ideological critique and evasive 'aesthetic' appreciation. He enhances readers' awareness of the ways Nazi filmmakers used the 'Jewish' Hollywood conventions Goebbels simultaneously feared and admired and their complex relationship with Weimar film culture. An immensely useful chronology of key events, the most extensive general bibliography of the subject ever compiled in English, and helpful filmographies of and bibliographies about the leading Nazi cineastes make this an essential acquisition.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Choice</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Ministry of Illusion</i> provides a long-awaited and meticulously researched examination of films in the Third Reich that will be of tremendous value to both scholars and educators.

When they are attacked by goblins, Kringle runs away, meets friendly shoe-repairing elves and pirates, and above all makes it his mission to rescue Merwen and hundreds of children. This fantasy combines magic (elven runes and flying reindeer), history (the end of the Roman occupation figures prominently, as does a certain Brother Alban), theology (Kringle is fascinated to learn about baby Jesus and his family), and a good dose of imagination to come up with a delightful explanation of the origins of our present-day Santa Claus.

Scholastic, $14.99 (0-439-74942-5).<br>Gr. 5&#x2013;8. On first glance, this story of how Kris Kringle came to live at the North Pole, surrounded by toy-making elves, sounds like the premise for a lighthearted cartoon. It is anything but. The boy Kringle lives in a dark wood in a dark age with Merwen, the old woman who has taken care of him since his mother died in childbirth. On the longest day of the year, the goblins come to enslave children. Kringle barely escapes, but Merwen is captured. So begins Kringle's long journey to find her, during which he learns his true purpose, after being rescued by elves, who aid him in the inevitable battle against evil. Framed in a world of cold and with religious overtones, the fantasy recalls C. S. Lewis' The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. In the end, Kringle triumphs and vows to make the year's longest day, which marks the birth of the Child, a happy one for children. Told in a come-nearer voice, this epic could have used some tightening, but the enticing premise, appealing young hero, and nonstop action will appeal to many fantasy lovers. &#x2013;&#x2013;Ilene Cooper<br>VOYA<br>Darkness lurks outside twelve-year-old Kringle's forest hut, the darkness of winter and of the goblins who pursue him. As the Romans withdraw from Britain and Norse invaders approach, the goblins kidnap children to power the mysterious Grunding, a war machine with which they plan to take over the world. Thrust into the role of rescuer, Kringle enlists the help of elves, pirates (Norsemen), and even reindeer as he travels north to confront the evil menace. Readers are hearing about Santa Claus, of course, but a Santa far removed from the commercial clichE. Abbott, author of the popular series Secrets of Droon, reimagines the old elf in a fresh and invigorating way. Like the archetypal hero, Kringle begins as a naOve boy and grows into his role. Familiar elements of the Christmas story-the elves, the sleigh, the North Pole home-fit convincingly into the book's internal logic. There are battles and blood, but the gentle narration of old Brother Alban balances these with incidents of goodness and compassion. Alban teaches Kringle about the Christ Child, so that, without a hint of preachiness, the religious significance of the season is integrated into the story. The plot could use some tightening, but that is a minor quibble. The book will have wide appeal for fantasy lovers and Narnia fans as well as seasonal browsers attracted by a beautiful cover and classy, gold-edged pages. Public libraries especially will want multiple copies of what should become a holiday family classic. -Kathleen Beck...<br><br>HBG<br>Horn Book Guide<br>(January 1, 2006; 0-439-74942-5; 978-0-439-74942-8)<br><br>In an elaborate, saccharine fantasy, Abbott explains how a boy named Kringle joins the elves, frees humanity from terror by defeating evil kidnapping goblins, and grows up to be the famous Christmas gift-give</p><h2>Monet&#39;s Garden: Through the Seasons at Giverny</h2><p>This behind-the-scenes exploration looks at the history of Claude Monet&#39;s garden at Giverny in France, and links the world of Monet the artist with Monet the gardener. Four chapters trace the garden through the different seasons of the year, paying special attention to the atmosphere and light that so preoccupied Monet and became the focus of his life as a painter. Throughout, the work done by Giverny&#39;s present-day gardeners is analysed to reveal the practical techniques of maintaining the most-visited garden in the world.</p><p>VIVIAN RUSSELL is a writer and photographer. She has written three other books on Monet - Monet&#39;s Landscapes, Monet&#39;s Waterlilies, and Planting Schemes for Monet&#39;s Garden. The original edition of Monet&#39;s Garden, published by Frances Lincoln in 1995, was awarded Book of the Year by the Garden Writer&#39;s Guild. She lives in Cumbria.Being the first American museum to acquire a Monet and now possessing a significant Monet collection, the Art Institute of Chicago is, not surprisingly, currently presenting the largest, most comprehensive retrospective of the artist's works ever staged. Distinguished art scholar and curator Stuckey has brought together from public and private collections worldwide works that represent every facet of the Impressionist painter's long career. In his introductory essay for this exhibition catalog, Stuckey points out gaps that exist in Monet scholarship, especially from the mid-1880s to the artist's death in 1926. A detailed, 71-page chronology including images of works by Monet's contemporaries, key Monet works not in the exhibition, and historical photographs underscores Monet's profound influence on modern art as well as art of the previous century. Above all, readers will luxuriate in the 161 magnificent full-color plates. Popular garden author Russell (Gardens of the Riviera, Rizzoli, 1994) highlights Monet's year-round horticultural talents and provides an ideal companion volume to the exhibition catalog. She traces Monet's purchase of the now-famous apple orchard site, his meticulous plans to convert Giverny to a natural, informal garden, and the recent, spectacular restoration. The nurseries from which Monet ordered water lilies and peonies, his "paintbox beds" for experimenting with colors, friendships with fellow gardeners Caillebotte and Clemenceau, and lively details of the day-to-day monumental maintenance chores combine with sumptuous color photographs of the restored garden, reproductions of paintings, and historical photographs to create a delightful publication. Monet's genius for using the garden as his canvas and immortalizing Giverny in impressionistic masterpieces is richly conveyed. Both volumes are highly recommended.?Joan Levin, MLS, Chicago<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Barbara Pym Cookbook</h2><p>The authors combine an intimate knowledge of Barbara Pym and her fictional characters with memories, anecdotes, appropriate callings from letters and diaries, and the family recipes that Pym drew upon and incorporated into all of her works</p><p>Barbara Pym is the twentieth-century literary heiress to Jane Austen, praised by the Huffington Post as &#x201c;the thinking girl&#x2019;s romance writer.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;</b><i>The Barbara Pym Cookbook</i>, which shows readers how to recreate the English teas and dinners featured in Pym&#x2019;s fiction, is the perfect companion for devoted fans.Barbara Pym (1913&#x2013;1980) was a bestselling and award-winning English novelist.

(Marilyn Burns Brainy Day Books)</h2><p>When Mrs. Comfort&#39;s guests rearrange all of her carefully placed tables and chairs, dinnertime at the family reunion becomes a complete mess, in a playful introduction to the concepts of area and perimeter.</p><p>Author and math teacher Marilyn Burns is noted for her many books that instill an interest and enthusiasm for mathematics into her school-age readers. Her books use traditional and original literature to address mathematical concepts. In addition to her instructive children&#x2019;s books Marilyn is the author of many books for teachers. She has also written books for children about food, time, and Hanukkah. She says that her writing career began as a fluke&#x201d; when a friend asked her to write a book about math. This was the jumping off point for her literary career, during which she has written about a dozen books for children and the same number for teachers. She currently gives lectures and lessons in schools. Burns was born in 1941 and resides in Sausalito, CA.Grade 2-4?Mr. and Mrs. Comfort decide to have a family dinner and invite their children, parents, in-laws, and neighbors. To seat the 32 guests, eight square tables and the appropriate number of chairs are rented and arranged according to a plan devised by Mrs. Comfort. However, as the guests arrive, they rearrange the furniture so they can sit together, resulting in mayhem until Mrs. Comfort's original configuration once again evolves. Subtitled "A Mathematical Story," the focus of this picture book is math concepts, not story. A note for adults suggests exercises in shapes and perimeter. Somewhat humorous, sketchy cartoons are busy and cluttered as guests of various ages and ethnicity rearrange furnishings, table settings, and food. While teachers might find this title useful for conveying math ideas, it is not a necessary purchase for most libraries.?Virginia Opocensky, formerly at Lincoln City Libraries, NE<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Walking Dead: Rise of the Governor</h2><p><p><b>Winner of the 2011 Diamond Gem Award for Trade Book of the Year</b></p><p>In the Walking Dead universe, there is no greater villain than The Governor. The despot who runs the walled-off town of Woodbury, he has his own sick sense of justice: whether it's forcing prisoners to battle zombies in an arena for the townspeople's amusement, or chopping off the appendages of those who cross him. The Governor was voted "Villain of the Year" by <i>Wizard</i> magazine the year he debuted, and his story arc was the most controversial in the history of the Walking Dead comic book series. Now, for the first time, fans of <i>The Walking Dead </i>will discover how The Governor became the man he is, and what drove him to such extremes.</p></p><p><p>Robert Kirkman is best known for his work on <i>The Walking Dead</i> and <i>Invincible</i> for Image Comics and SKYBOUND.

Sadly, the only hands Brian currently owns are busy right now, covering the tiny ears of a little girl in the closet next to him.<br>The seven-year-old keeps shuddering in his arms, jerking at the intermittent <i>THWACK-GAHHHH-THUMP</i> outside the closet. Then comes the silence, broken only by the sticky sound of boot steps on bloody tile, and a flurry of angry whispers out in the vestibule.<br>Brian starts coughing again. He can&#x2019;t help it. For days he has been fighting this goddamn cold, a stubborn blight on his joints and sinuses that he cannot shake. It happens to him every fall, when the Georgia days start getting dank and gloomy. The dampness gets into his bones, saps his energy, and steals his breath. And now he feels the pounding stab of a fever with each cough.<br>Doubling over in another hacking, wheezing fit, he keeps his hands pressed down on little Penny&#x2019;s ears as he coughs. He knows the sound of his rasping is attracting all kinds of attention outside the closet door, out in the convolutions of the house, but there&#x2019;s nothing he can do about it. He sees tracings of light with each cough&#x2014;like tiny filigrees of fireworks across his blind pupils.<br>The closet&#x2014;barely four feet wide, and maybe three feet deep&#x2014;is as dark as an inkwell, and it reeks of mothballs, mouse droppings, and old cedar. Plastic coat bags hang down in the darkness, brushing the sides of Brian&#x2019;s face. Brian&#x2019;s younger brother Philip told him it was okay to cough in the closet. In fact, Brian was free to cough his fucking head off&#x2014;it would draw out the monsters&#x2014;but Brian better not give his goddamn cold to Philip&#x2019;s little girl. If he did, Philip would crack <i>Brian&#x2019;</i>s head open.<br>The coughing fit passes.<br>Moments later, another pair of lumbering footsteps disturbs the silence outside the closet&#x2014;another dead thing entering the kill zone. Brian squeezes his hands tighter against Penny&#x2019;s ears, and the child flinches at another rendition of Skull Splitting in D minor.<br>If asked to describe the racket outside the closet, Brian Blake would probably revert to his days as a failed music store entrepreneur and tell you that the head-cracking sounds are like a percussive symphony they might play in hell&#x2014;like some trippy outtake from Edgard Var�se or a druggy drum solo from John Bonham&#x2014;with repeating verses and choruses: the heavy breathing of humans&nbsp;... the shambling footsteps of another moving corpse&nbsp;... the whistle of an axe&nbsp;... the <i>thunk</i> of steel sinking into flesh&nbsp;...<br>... and finally, the big finale, the splat of moist, dead weight on the slimy parquet.<br>Another break in the action sends fever chills down Brian&#x2019;s spine. The silence closes in again. Eyes now adjusted to the darkness, Brian sees the first shimmer of thick arterial blood seeping under the bottom of the door. It looks like motor oil. He gently yanks his niece away from the spreading puddle, pulling her back against the boots and umbrellas along the back wall.<br>The hem of Penny Blake&#x2019;s little denim dress touches the blood. She quickly pulls the fabric away, and frantically rubs at the stain, as if the very absorption of the blood will infect her somehow.<br>Another convulsive coughing fit doubles Brian over. He fights it. He swallows the broken glass of a sore throat and pulls the little girl into a full-on embrace. He doesn&#x2019;t know what to do or say. He wants to help his niece. He wants to whisper something reassuring to her but cannot think of a single reassuring thing to whisper.<br>The girl&#x2019;s father would know what to say. Philip would know. He always knows what to say. Philip Blake is the guy who says the things that everybody else <i>wishes</i> they had said. He says what needs to be said, and he does what needs to be done. Like right now. He&#x2019;s out there with Bobby and Nick, doing what needs to be done&nbsp;... while Brian hunkers here in the dark like a scared rabbit, wishing he knew what to say to his niece.<br>Considering the fact that Brian Blake is the oldest of the two siblings, it&#x2019;s odd how Brian has always been the runt. Barely five feet seven in his boot heels, Brian Blake is a raw-boned scarecrow of a man scarcely able to fill out his black peg-leg jeans and torn Weezer T-shirt. A mousey goatee, macram� bracelets, and a thatch of dark Ichabod Crane hair complete the picture of a thirty-five-year-old Bohemian waif stuck in Peter Pan limbo, now kneeling in the mothball-scented gloom.<br>Brian sucks in a hoarse breath and looks down at the doe-eyed Penny, her mute, horrified face ghostly in the darkness of the closet. The child has always been a quiet little girl, with an almost porcelain complexion, like that of a china doll, which has given her face a rather ethereal cast. But since her mother&#x2019;s death she has turned even further inward, becoming more wan and stoic, to the point of appearing almost translucent, with tendrils of raven-black hair obscuring her huge eyes.<br>For the last three days, she has hardly said a word. Of course, they have been three <i>extraordinary</i> days&#x2014;and trauma works differently on children than it does on adults&#x2014;but Brian is worried that Penny is perhaps slipping into some kind of shock.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s gonna be okay, kiddo,&#x201d; Brian whispers to her with a lame little cough as punctuation.<br>She says something without looking up at him. She mumbles it, staring down at the floor, a tear pearling on her dirty cheek.<br>&#x201c;What was that, Pen?&#x201d; Brian cradles her against him and wipes her tear.<br>She says something again, and again, and again, but not exactly to Brian. She says it more like a mantra, or a prayer, or an incantation: <i>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s never-ever going to be okay, never-ever-ever-ever-ever.&#x201d;</i><br>&#x201c;Sshhhhh.&#x201d; He holds her head, pressing it gently against the folds of his T-shirt. He feels the damp heat of her face against his ribs. He covers her ears again as he hears the <i>THWACK</i> of another axe blade outside the closet, smashing through the membrane of a scalp, into the hard shell of a skull, through the layers of dura, and into the pulpy gray gelatin of an occipital lobe.<br>It makes a smacking noise like a baseball bat hitting a wet softball&#x2014;the ejaculate of blood like a mop head slapping the floor&#x2014;followed by a ghastly, wet thud. Oddly, that&#x2019;s the worst part for Brian: that hollow, moist thump of a body landing on expensive ceramic tile. The tile is custom made for the house, with elaborate inlay and Aztec designs. It&#x2019;s a lovely house&nbsp;... or at least, it once was.<br>Again the noises cease.<br>Again the horrible dripping silence follows. Brian stifles a cough, holding it in like a firecracker that&#x2019;s about to pop, so he can better hear the minute changes in breathing outside the closet, the greasy footsteps shuffling through gore. But the place is dead silent now.<br>Brian feels the child seize up next to him&#x2014;little Penny girding herself for another salvo of axe blows&#x2014;but the silence stretches.<br>Inches away, the sound of a bolt clicking, and the closet doorknob turning, rashes Brian&#x2019;s body with gooseflesh. The door swings open.<br>&#x201c;Okay, we&#x2019;re good.&#x201d; The baritone voice, whiskey-cured and smoky, comes from a man peering down into the recesses of the closet. Eyes blinking at the darkness, face shimmering with sweat, flush with the exertion of zombie disposal, Philip Blake holds a grue-slick axe in his workman&#x2019;s hand.<br>&#x201c;You sure?&#x201d; Brian utters.<br>Ignoring his brother, Philip gazes down at his daughter. &#x201c;Everything&#x2019;s okay, punkin, Daddy&#x2019;s okay.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Are you <i>sure</i>?&#x201d; Brian says with a cough.<br>Philip looks at his brother. &#x201c;You mind covering your mouth, sport?&#x201d;<br>Brian wheezes, &#x201c;You sure it&#x2019;s clear?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Punkin?&#x201d; Philip Blake addresses his daughter tenderly, his faint Southern drawl belying the bright, feral embers of violence just now fading in his eyes. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m gonna need y&#x2019;all to stay right there for a minute. Awright? You stay right there until Daddy says it&#x2019;s okay to come out. You understand?&#x201d;<br>With a slight nod, the pale little girl gives him a feeble gesture of understanding.<br>&#x201c;C&#x2019;mon, sport,&#x201d; Philip urges his older brother out of the shadows. &#x201c;Gonna need your help with the cleanup.&#x201d;<br>Brian struggles to his feet, pushing his way through the hanging overcoats.<br>He emerges from the closet and blinks at the harsh light of the vestibule. He stares and coughs and stares some more. For a brief moment, it looks as though the lavish entryway of the two-story Colonial, brightly lit by fancy copper chandeliers, is in the throes of being redecorated by a work crew afflicted by palsy. Great swaths of eggplant-purple spatters stain the teal green plaster walls. Rorschach patterns of black and crimson adorn the baseboards and moldings. Then the shapes on the floor register.<br>Six bodies lie akimbo in bloody heaps. Ages and genders are obscured by the wet carnage, the mottled, livid skin tones, and the misshapen skulls. The largest lies in a spreading pool of bile at the foot of the great circular staircase. Another one, perhaps the lady of the house, perhaps once a convivial hostess offering peach cobbler and Southern hospitality, is now splayed across the lovely white parquet floor in a contorted mess, a stringer of wormy gray matter flagging from her breached cranium.<br>Brian Blake feels his gorge rising, his throat involuntarily dilating.<br>&#x201c;Okay, gentlemen, we got our work cut out for us,&#x201d; Philip is saying, addressing his tw...</p><h2>Birth of the Messiah: A Commentary on the Infancy Narratives in Matthew and Luke</h2><p>Over his illustrious career, Raymond E.

Each of the novels, <i>Word of Honor</i>, <i>Cathedral</i>, and <i>By the Rivers of Babylon</i>, is very different in plot, but clearly patented by DeMille's distinctive fingerprints: a fascination for 20th-century politics, a high level of human interest, and ongoing clashes of good versus evil. <p> In <i>Word of Honor</i>, Vietnam veteran Ben Tyson is accused of committing a heinous wartime crime. As his reputation and his inner spirit are battered, Ben must fight the biggest battle of his life. </p><p> <i>Cathedral</i> takes place on St. Patrick's Day, in New York City. A renegade I.R.A. group seizes a huge cathedral, along with the worshippers inside. As the hours pass and the tension mounts, the fate of the hostages does not look good.</p><p> Finally, the hotly contested Arab-Israeli conflict serves as the nucleus of inspiration for <i>By the Rivers of Babylon</i>.

After a flaw was discovered in the proof, Wiles had to work for another year--he had already labored in solitude for seven years--to establish that he had solved the 350-year-old problem. Simon Singh's book is a lively, comprehensible explanation of Wiles's work and of the star-, trauma-, and wacko-studded history of Fermat's last theorem. <i>Fermat's Enigma</i> contains some problems that offer a taste of the math, but it also includes limericks to give a feeling for the goofy side of mathematicians."An excellent account of one of the most dramatic and moving events of the century."<br>--Sir Roger Penrose, <i>New York Times Book Review</i><p>"It is hard to imagine a more gripping account of...this centuries-long drama of ingenious failures, crushed hopes, fatal duels, and suicides."<br>--Jim Holt, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i></p><p>"Though Singh may not ask us to bring too much algebra to the table, he does expect us to appreciate a good detective story." <br><i>--Boston Sunday Globe</i></p><p>"The history of mathematics comes alive even for those who dread balancing their checkbooks." <br><i>--Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>"Singh captures the joys and frustrations of this quest for an extremely elusive proof...and builds to a truly engrossing climax.

It means fatigue and confusion, it means trying to separate every experience into the real and the unreal and not sometimes being aware of where the edges overlap. It means trying to think straight when there is a maze of experiences getting in the way, and when thoughts are continually being sucked out of your head so that you become embarrassed to speak at meetings. It means feeling sometimes that you are inside your head and visualising yourself walking over your brain, or watching another girl wearing your clothes and carrying out actions as you think them. It means knowing that you are continually "watched," that you can never succeed in life because the laws are all against you and knowing that your ultimate destruction is never far away. </p><p>Patient with schizophrenia, quoted in Henry R. Rollin, Coping with Schizophrenia </p><p>When tragedy strikes, one of the things that make life bearable for people is the sympathy of friends and relatives. This can be seen, for example, in a natural disaster like a flood and with a chronic disease like cancer. Those closest to the person afflicted offer help, extend their sympathy, and generally provide important solace and support in the person's time of need. "Sympathy," said Emerson, "is a supporting atmosphere, and in it we unfold easily and well." A prerequisite for sympathy is an ability to put oneself in the place of the person afflicted. One must be able to imagine oneself in a flood or getting cancer. Without this ability to put oneself in the place of the person afflicted, there can be abstract pity but not true sympathy. </p><p>Sympathy for those afflicted with schizophrenia is sparse because it is difficult to put oneself in the place of the sufferer. The whole disease process is mysterious, foreign, and frightening to most people. As noted by Roy Porter in A Social History of Madness, "strangeness has typically been the key feature in the fractured dialogues that go on, or the silences that intrude, between the &#x2018;mad' and the &#x2018;sane.' Madness is a foreign country." </p><p>Schizophrenia, then, is not like a flood, where one can imagine all one's possessions being washed away. Nor like a cancer, where one can imagine a slowly growing tumor, relentlessly spreading from organ to organ and squeezing life from your body. No, schizophrenia is madness. Those who are afflicted act bizarrely, say strange things, withdraw from us, and may even try to hurt us. They are no longer the same person&#x2014;they are mad! We don't understand why they say what they say and do what they do. We don't understand the disease process. Rather than a steadily growing tumor, which we can understand, it is as if the person has lost control of his/her brain. How can we sympathize with a person who is possessed by unknown and unseen forces? How can we sympathize with a madman or a madwoman? </p><p>The paucity of sympathy for those with schizophrenia makes it that much more of a disaster. Being afflicted with the disease is bad enough by itself. Those of us who have not had this disease should ask ourselves, for example, how we would feel if our brain began playing tricks on us, if unseen voices shouted at us, if we lost the capacity to feel emotions, and if we lost the ability to reason logically. As one individual with schizophrenia noted: "My greatest fear is this brain of mine. . . . The worst thing imaginable is to be terrified of one's own mind, the very matter that controls all that we are and all that we do and feel." This would certainly be burden enough for any human being to have to bear. But what if, in addition to this, those closest to us began to avoid us or ignore us, to pretend that they didn't hear our comments, to pretend that they didn't notice what we did? How would we feel if those we most cared about were embarrassed by our behavior each day? </p><p>Because there is little understanding of schizophrenia, so there is little sympathy. For this reason it is the obligation of everyone with a relative or close friend with schizophrenia to learn as much as possible about what the disease is and what the afflicted person is experiencing. This is not merely an intellectual exercise or a way to satisfy one's curiosity but rather the means to make it possible to sympathize with the person. For friends and relatives who want to be helpful, probably the most important thing to do is to learn about the inner workings of the brain of a person with schizophrenia. One mother wrote me after listening to her afflicted son's descriptions of his hallucinations: "I saw into the visual hallucinations that plagued him and frankly, at times, it raised the hair on my neck. It also helped me to get outside of my tragedy and to realize how horrible it is for the person who is afflicted. I thank God for that painful wisdom. I am able to cope easier with all of this." </p><p>With sympathy, schizophrenia is a personal tragedy. Without sympathy, it becomes a family calamity, for there is nothing to knit people together, no balm for the wounds. Understanding schizophrenia also helps demystify the disease and brings it from the realm of the occult to the daylight of reason. As we come to understand it, the face of madness slowly changes before us from one of terror to one of sadness. For the sufferer, this is a significant change. </p><p>The best way to learn what a person with schizophrenia experiences is to listen to someone with the disease. For this reason I have relied heavily upon patients' own accounts in describing the signs and symptoms. There are some excellent descriptions scattered throughout English literature; the best of these are listed . . .</p></p><h2>Your Nostradamus Factor</h2><p>Teaches readers how to calculate their own &#34;Nostradamus factor,&#34; their innate abilities to see into the future, explaining how to use dreams for prophecy and understand the natural predictive cycle</p><p></p><h2>Step-By-Step Tarot (Complete Course in Tarot Readership)</h2><p>Step-By-Step Tarot is a course aimed at demystifying tarot reading.</p><p>For beginners and more experienced students, this fun and accessible step-by-step workbook provides a complete course in how to read the enigmatic messages of tarot cards.This practical workbook offers an easy to follow step-by-step course for understanding and working with the tarot.

Now, with <i>Popular Crime, </i>James takes readers on an epic journey from Lizzie Borden to the Lindbergh baby, from the Black Dahlia to O. J. Simpson, explaining how crimes have been committed, investigated, prosecuted and written about, and how that has profoundly influenced our culture over the last few centuries&#x2014; even if we haven&#x2019;t always taken notice. <br><br>Exploring such phenomena as serial murder, the fluctuation of crime rates, the value of evidence, radicalism and crime, prison reform and the hidden ways in which crimes have shaped, or reflected, our society, James chronicles murder and misdeeds from the 1600s to the present day. James pays particular attention to crimes that were sensations during their time but have faded into obscurity, as well as still-famous cases, some that have never been solved, including the Lindbergh kidnapping, the Boston Strangler and JonBenet Ramsey. Satisfyingly sprawling and tremendously entertaining, <i>Popular Crime </i>is a professed amateur&#x2019;s powerful examination of the incredible impact crime stories have on our society, culture and history.</p><p>Bill James made his mark in the 1970s and 1980s with his <i>Baseball Abstracts</i>. He has been tearing down preconceived notions about America&#x2019;s national pastime ever since. He is currently the Senior Advisor on Baseball Operations for the Boston Red Sox, as well as the author of <i>The Man from the Train</i>. James lives in Lawrence, Kansas, with his wife, Susan McCarthy, and three children.Popular Crime I<p></p> <br><br> <br>In Rome in the year 24 AD, the praetor Plautius Silvanus pushed his wife Apronia out of the window in the middle of the night. They hadn&#x2019;t been married very long, or, we might guess, very happily. It was a high window, and she did not survive the fall.<br> <br>Silvanus was a member of one of Rome&#x2019;s most celebrated and successful families. His father, also Plautius Silvanus, had been consul in 2 BCE. His grandmother, Urgulania, was a close friend of the empress, and a cousin, Urgulanilla, was then married to the man who would later become the emperor Claudius.<br> <br>Apronia&#x2019;s father rushed to the palace and awakened the emperor Tiberius. Tiberius went immediately to the scene of the crime, where he saw obvious signs of a struggle and the marks of Apronia being forced out the window. Silvanus had no explanation. He claimed that he had been asleep at the time, and that Apronia must have leapt to her death. He was arrested, judges were appointed, and Tiberius presented his evidence to the Roman senate.<br> <br>A great public scandal arose, in the midst of which Urgulania sent her grandson a dagger. This was taken to be a hint. Silvanus attempted to stab himself with the dagger, and, that failing, apparently enlisted the aid of confederates; in any case, Tacitus records that he &#x201c;allowed his veins to be opened,&#x201d; and was soon gone.<br> <br>There was still to be a trial, however. Silvanus&#x2019; first wife, Numantina, was put on trial on charges of having driven her late ex-husband insane with incantations and potions ... what we would now call &#x201c;witchcraft.&#x201d; She was acquitted.<br> <br>Silvanus&#x2019; family was destroyed by the scandal. Claudius divorced Urgulanilla, who was believed to have been implicated in the matter in some opaque way. The grandmother disappears from history.<br> <br><br> <br>In 61 AD the Prefect of the city of Rome, L. Pedanius Secundus, became embroiled in a dispute with one of his slaves, either because he had agreed to release the slave for a price and then reneged on the deal&#x2014;the story told by the slave&#x2014;or because Pedanius and the slave had both fallen in love with the same slave boy who was kept as a prostitute, which was apparently the story circulated in the streets. In any case, Pedanius was murdered by the slave.<br> <br>Roman law required that, when a slave murdered his master, all of the slaves residing in the household were to be executed&#x2014;in fact, even if the master died accidentally within his house, the slaves were sometimes executed for failing to protect the master. Pedanius had 400 slaves. The law had been as it was for hundreds of years, Roman law being harder to change than the course of a river, and there had been cases before in which large numbers of slaves had been executed, but now people were losing respect for the old values, and the slaves no longer saw the point in this tradition. Crowds of plebs&#x2014;rank-and-file civilians, neither slaves nor aristocracy&#x2014;gathered to protest the executions. Rioting broke out, and not for the first time, incidentally. Rioting had erupted over the same issue at other times through the centuries.<br> <br>The senate debated the matter, and most of the senators realized that the executions were unjust. They were unable to block implementation of the law, however, and the order was given that the executions must be carried out. Troops attempted to seize the slaves, but a crowd gathered to defend them, armed with stones and torches, and the soldiers were beaten back. By now Claudius&#x2019; stepson Nero was the emperor, never known for his civility. Nero ordered thousands of soldiers to the scene. The slaves were taken into custody, and legions of soldiers lined the streets along which they were taken to be put to death.<br> <br><br> <br>Ordinarily, crime stories sink gradually beneath the waves of history, as proper stiff-upper-lip historians are generally above re-telling them, but street riots are one of the things that sometimes cause them to float. On January 1, 1753, an 18-year-old girl disappeared from a country lane in an area which is now part of London, but which at that time linked London to the village of Whitechapel. Employed as a maid in London, Elizabeth Canning had spent New Year&#x2019;s Day with her aunt and uncle in Whitechapel. As the holiday drew toward evening she headed back to London, and the aunt and uncle walked with her part of the way. With less than a mile to go along the thinly populated lane her relatives turned back, assuming that she would be safe making the last leg of the trek alone in the gathering dusk. In 1753, of course, the streets were unlit, and also, London had no regular police service. She had with her a little bit of money, what was left of her Christmas money, which was called a &#x201c;Christmas Box,&#x201d; and a mince pie that she was carrying as a treat for one of her younger brothers.<br> <br>She failed to arrive back in London. What happened then is oddly familiar to us. Her mother immediately raised the alarm, and her friends, relatives and her employers immediately organized a volunteer search. Within hours of her disappearance they were knocking on doors throughout the area, and within two days they had covered much of London with advertisements and fliers asking for information and offering a small reward. Her disappearance attracted the attention of the city. Someone along the lane thought that he remembered hearing a woman scream about the time she disappeared.<br> <br>The search, however, went nowhere for several weeks. On January 29, late in the evening, Miss Canning suddenly reappeared at her mother&#x2019;s house, looking so bedraggled that her mother, when first Elizabeth came through the door, had not the slightest idea who she was. She had bruises on her face and body, a bad cut near one ear, she was dirty and emaciated and the nice dress she had been wearing at the time she disappeared had been replaced by rags. Her mother screamed, and, in the crowded part of London where they lived, the house filled quickly with friends and curious neighbors.<br> <br>At this point the system of justice, such as it was, flew into action with unfortunate speed. Her neighbors began peppering her with questions about her disappearance&#x2014;an obvious lapse of judgment, but what do you expect from eighteenth century peasants? We&#x2019;re lucky they weren&#x2019;t carrying pitchforks. Where have you been? Who took you? Where were you held? When you escaped, where did you find yourself ?<br> <br>Elizabeth, I believe, tried to answer these questions as best she could in her desperate condition. The story that she told, confused and disjointed and somewhat incoherent, is that, walking along the lane on the fateful holiday, she had been accosted by two thugs, who robbed her of her coins and her nice dress, and then pushed and dragged her several miles to a large house. There they turned her over to a group of women who made some half-hearted efforts to force her into a life of immoral trade. Resisting these efforts, she was locked in the hayloft&#x2014;the attic, we would call it now&#x2014;and apparently forgotten until she finally managed to escape, injuring her ear in the process. She had lived for four weeks on a loaf of bread, a pitcher of water and the mince pie.<br> <br>Within minutes, the finger of suspicion had been pointed at the residents of a particular house, a large house filled with gypsies, tramps and thieves. There were some loose women who lived there, and some other oddballs and eccentrics. Yes, said Elizabeth; that sounds like that must be the house.<br> <br>She was given a day to rest and recover, and then taken before an Alderman, who interrogated her and expressed some doubts about her account, but ultimately issued a warrant for a search of the property in question. A posse of Elizabeth&#x2019;s over-eager friends descended on the house, accompanied by a representative of the Lord Mayor of London and by other officials. All of the residents of the house were arrested. They were arraigned days later before a Justice of the Peace, who happened to be the novelist Henry Fielding. Fielding issued warrants for the detention of two women.<br> <br>This story, very much like the story of the Duke Lacrosse team, would soon explode into a divisive national controversy with political overtones, occupying the attention of the British people to an extent that is ultimately inexplicable. Elizabeth Canning was destined to become, for a few months at least, perhaps the most famous person in the world. Crime stories of this magnitude make entire cast and crew into celebrities. In this cast we have an old gypsy woman named Mary Squires, with a face like a child&#x2019;s drawing of a witch, and a mistress of the house called Mother Wells, and in the crew we have a man bearing the moniker (I am not making this up) Fortune Natus, and a young prostitute named Virtue Hall.<br> <br>Mary Squires smoked a pipe and would tell your fortune for a penny. She was the ugliest woman in the history of the world, a skinny old crone with a face full of warts, a nose the size of a pear and a lower lip, said the writers, the size of an infant&#x2019;s arm. Ms. Canning accused Squires and Susannah Wells, who owned the house, of stealing her corsets or, as they were called at the time, her &#x201c;stays.&#x201d; (They were probably called &#x201c;stays&#x201d; because they helped the woman&#x2019;s body stay where it was put.) The underwear was worth perhaps less than Ms. Virtue&#x2019;s virtue, but at that time one could be hanged for theft in England, and while that was not the usual punishment this was not the usual case. In the early days of the story, due to the great public sympathy for Ms. Canning, her accusations were accepted at face value, and by late February the old gypsy stood in the shadow of the gallows.<br> <br>The mayor of London at that time was Sir Crispe Gascoyne. Gascoyne became concerned that an injustice was occurring on his watch, and took it upon himself to prevent this. The story told by Elizabeth Canning had serious problems. She had given a description of the house which did not match the suspect dwelling in one particular after another, and she had failed to mention things about the hayloft which, having been locked in there for 28 days, she could hardly have failed to notice. It seemed to many observers inexplicable that, in describing the events before the court, she had failed to give a hint about her assailant&#x2019;s quite remarkable face. Further, Mrs. Squires stated immediately upon being accused that on the first of January she had been a hundred and twenty miles away, and, on investigation, this appeared to be true; once somebody finally bothered to check, she had witnesses.<br> <br>The trumpet of justice had sounded, however, and Ms. Canning refused to recant. All of England now began to choose sides, the Canningites against the Egyptians (the gypsies being commonly believed to have originated in Egypt). Which side you were on tended to match up with which pub you socialized in. There was a class division, somewhat inaccessible to us now, between domestic servants and lower-class people who lacked a position.<br> <br>So one pub would decide that Mrs. Squires was guilty and the one across the street would decide that Miss Canning was lying, and occasionally they would meet in the middle of the street and try to settle the matter with fists and stones. Canning&#x2019;s supporters raised large amounts of money to prosecute those she had accused; Squires&#x2019; defenders raised essentially equal amounts for the other side. A legal battle raged back and forth for a year, bills of indictment being sought and obtained on all sides. Henry Fielding authored a pamphlet, A Clear Statement of the Case of Elizabeth Canning, supporting the Canningites; Tobias Smollett was among many publishing on the other side of the issue. Voltaire published a history of the affair (Histoire d&#x2019;Elisabeth Canning, et de Jean Calas). At one point the Lord Mayor&#x2014;the head of the Egyptians, who opposed Canning&#x2014;was dragged from his coach and roughed up by a mob of Canningites.<br> <br>Mother Wells, immediately upon being convicted as a thief, was branded with a red-hot iron, the letter &#x201c;T&#x201d; being seared into her skin near her thumb. This was done in open court in full view of the spectators to the trial. Mary Squires, sentenced to be hanged, was pardoned by the King, outraging Canning&#x2019;s supporters, some of whom lobbed stones at the King&#x2019;s carriage. In April of 1754, a little more than a year after the first event, Elizabeth stood trial at the Old Bailey on a charge of perjury, accused of giving false testimony against Mary Squires. The trial lasted for seven days, making it perhaps the longest trial of a commoner in English history up to that point, and certainly the most avidly followed. She was convicted on a close vote, a unanimous verdict not being required, and was ordered to be transported to America for seven years as punishment.<br> <br>Elizabeth&#x2019;s opponents insisted that she had made up the whole story as an excuse for some adventure that had gone awry. This is unlikely. Her supporters insisted to the end that she was right about everything except a few details of her account, that Mary Squires&#x2019; gypsy friends had created a false alibi. This is unlikely. Miss Canning may have suffered exactly what she said she had suffered, but mixed up the details in her confusion, and wound up innocently participating in the prosecution of innocent people. She may have run off to meet a man she knew or thought she knew, and found herself in a horrible situation, which she never came clean about. She may have lied to avoid admitting that she had been raped. Ultimately, we just do not know.<br> <br>Elizabeth Canning&#x2019;s supporters raised money for her to travel to America in comfort and with a little bit of a purse, to which the British judicial system made no objections. On the ship across the Atlantic she was befriended by a Philadelphia minister and his wife. She met and married a well-off young man named John Treat, the grandson of a former Connecticut governor, bore three sons and a daughter, died before the revolution, and is believed to be buried in Wethersfield, Connecticut.<br> <br><br> <br>The modern American phenomenon of popular crime stories is in absolutely no way new, modern, or American. That it is truly a universal phenomenon throughout human history perhaps should not be asserted without a more complete survey, but I know of no society which did not have sensational crimes and huge public interest in them, except perhaps societies which were so repressive that the government was able to quash them.<br> <br>Crime stories rush by us like oncoming traffic. New crime stories emerge in the national media almost every day. Each one roars by us for a few days, is remarked upon in casual conversation and filed away as something less than a memory. Occasionally a crime story turns and follows us, visible in our mirror for months or years afterward. Each one is important to somebody, and a few of them&#x2014;something less than 2% of the murders&#x2014;become books.<br> <br>We are, not as a nation but as human beings, fascinated by crime stories, even obsessed with them. The Bible is full of them. On your television at this moment there are four channels covering true crime stories, and five more doing detective fiction. And yet, on a certain level, we are profoundly ashamed of this fascination. If you go into a good used book store and ask if they have a section of crime books, ...</p><h2>Wizard of Oz Scanimation: 10 Classic Scenes from Over the Rainbow</h2><p>We&#x2019;re off to see the wizard!

He does so against everyone&#39;s advice, but when he watches the sun rise slowly after the Battle of Joncourt, he realizes why he couldn&#39;t have stayed back. And mysteriously, so do we. Peter Firth&#39;s reading captures perfectly Barker&#39;s tragic mix of pity and apotheosis. An accomplished British actor, Firth is at once the cynical, but savvy, Prior, the stammering Professor Dodgson (Lewis Carroll), soft-spoken Dr. Rivers, all with transparent ease. His unerring sense of character and tone recreates the bitter irony of that last push in 1918 when so many died so needlessly. For Barker, these last dead, though they sour the trumpet of victory, are war&#39;s only winners. At the end Firth&#39;s silence becomes eloquent. P.E.F. An AUDIOFILE Earphones Award winner.

Unfortunately, this biography of a former Chicago Cubs player falls in the latter category. It is not that the writing is poor, but rather that Santo's story is typical: the rise of a young baseball star; the reasonably successful major league career (Santo was a minor star); and retirement in business and broadcasting. The only hook to the story is the fact that Santo is a diabetic. However, he discusses how he hid his illness more than how he overcame it, so the inspirational aspect is lost. Putting Santo's career in perspective is difficult. The fact remains that he was the second or third most important player on a team that never won a championship--hardly the stuff legends are made of. This is a pedestrian biography that will appeal only to the most dedicated Chicago Cubs fans.<br><i>- William O. Scheeren, Hempfield Area H.S.

When he signed his first baseball contract, he learned that he had diabetes, he recalls, but the disease caused no problems with his athletic career.

However, Santo's contention that the 1969 Cubs, who lost the pennant to the Mets in the last few weeks of the season, were the best Cubs team of the modern era is arguable.

Asprey gives us more of the personality and passion that marks this swift-moving, intensely dramatic saga.In The Rise of Napoleon Bonaparte, Asprey showed us that Napoleon was not the father of chaos but rather an heir to chaos. In this sequel, we see Napoleon struggling to deal with that chaos. We peer over Napoleon&#39;s shoulder as he solidifies his growing empire through a series of dynastic marriages, military victories, and shrewd diplomatic manipulations. We watch Napoleon lose control of his empire, plot his return from Elba, rally peasants in his march on Paris, and endure defeat at Waterloo and exile to St. Helena. The concluding installment to this exciting, reckless thrill ride shows Napoleon as he was-not saint, not sinner, but a man dedicated to and ultimately devoured by his vision of himself, his empire, and his world.</p><p>Between the years 1805 and 1815, the armies of Napoleon Bonaparte conquered most of continental Europe, establishing their leader, if but briefly, as "a new Charlemagne." In the second part of his two volumes on the life of the emperor, military historian Robert Asprey examines the armies' triumphs and eventual defeat, following in their footsteps from Spain to Russia, and on to Waterloo.<p> Bonaparte, Asprey writes, aspired to forge and lead a united, peaceful Europe, a quest that required much blood to be shed. A former U.S. marine officer, Asprey is a reliable commentator on matters of battlefield strategy and tactics, and his book's greatest strength is his power to invoke the feel of bloody engagements, which include the Battle of Borodino, where more than 40,000 Russians fell in a single day (cut down, he notes, by the more than 2 million rounds that French muskets fired); Wagram, where French forces managed to eke out victory over their Austrian foes despite a series of costly blunders; Corunna, where the French forces, having marched 15 and more miles a day, proved "that there have probably been no tougher soldiers in the world"; and the decisive action at Waterloo, where French, Belgian, German, and English armies clashed amid thunderstorms and confusion to an end that was anything but inevitable.</p><p> Other books do a better job of treating Napoleon as a political being, but Asprey's is one of the better recent books on Napoleon as general, and students of military history will learn much from his account. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Robert Asprey is a former U.S. Marine captain and an accomplished and esteemed military historian.

It reminded them of their courting days, back in high school, when Fair, bruised from Friday night&#x2019;s football game, would pick up Harry, dirty from the stable, and they&#x2019;d drive around in his 1958 Chevy pickup. Now, over two decades later, Fair was at the wheel of their station wagon, Harry beside him, the pets in the back seat, as they rode through the countryside.<br><br>Mrs. Murphy, the tiger cat, Pewter, her gray, overweight sidekick, and Tucker, the corgi, usually accompanied their people everywhere except in high heat.

Harry walked around to the rear of the car and opened the hatch door; the animals jumped back into their original seats.<br><br>Slamming both doors shut, Harry cursed as Fair couldn&#x2019;t help but laugh. She walked over to the driver&#x2019;s side; he had the window down.<br><br>&#x201c;They know how to pluck your last nerve,&#x201d; said Fair, laughing.<br><br>&#x201c;Yours, too. I&#x2019;m not the one who pulled the car over.&#x201d; Harry looked down the road at the produce stand, a small white clapboard building with a large overhang, goods displayed in orderly, colorful rows. &#x201c;Hey, let&#x2019;s get some pattypan squash. Bet Hester still has some.&#x201d; She walked around the car, getting in the passenger side before turning to face her animal tormentors. &#x201c;If I hear one peep, one sniff, one hiss while I am shopping, no food tonight. Got it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hateful.&#x201d; Pewter turned her back on Harry.<br><br>As Tucker hung her head, Mrs. Murphy, the tiger cat, loudly defended herself. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t do one thing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course not, the perfect puss.&#x201d; Pewter curled her upper lip.<br><br>Fair coasted to the stand, where Hester&#x2014;�orange apron, black jeans, and an orange shirt&#x2014;�was talking to customers, most of whom lived in Crozet or nearby.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll stay here.&#x201d; Fair knew how Hester could go on, plus Buddy Janss was there, all three hundred pounds of him, and he could outtalk Hester.<br><br>Orange and black bunting festooned the roof overhang. Scarecrows flanked the outdoor wooden cartons overflowing with squashes, pumpkins, every kind of apple imaginable. Inside, one could buy a good sandwich. Little ghosts floated from the rafters; big green eyes glowed in the room&#x2019;s upper corners. Brilliantly gold late corn and huge mums and zinnias added to the color.<br><br>Almost as big as Buddy, a sign sat catty-�cornered to the entrance, announcing the community Halloween Hayride to raise money for the Crozet Library. No doubt Tazio Chappars, an architect, had designed the impressive sign. She worked hard for the library and the sign really grabbed you: From a large drawn skeleton, one bony arm actually reached out to get your attention.<br><br>Hester looked up. &#x201c;Harry Haristeen, I haven&#x2019;t seen you in weeks.&#x201d;<br><br>Buddy turned. &#x201c;How&#x2019;d you do with your sunflowers?&#x201d;<br><br>Buddy, a farmer who rented thousands of acres along with cultivating his own holdings, enjoyed Harry&#x2019;s foray into niche farming. Who knew better than Buddy the cost of equipment and implements for wheat, corn, soybeans? Harry had made a wise choice in focusing on her field of sunflowers, her quarter acre of Petit Manseng grapes, and the ginseng she grew down by the strong deep creek that divided her property from the old Jones farm.<br><br>&#x201c;Pretty good,&#x201d; she said, not wanting to brag that this year&#x2019;s field of sunflowers was her biggest yet. &#x201c;How&#x2019;s your year so far?&#x201d;<br><br>He hooked his thumbs in his overalls. &#x201c;Tell you what, girl, that mini-�drought thinned out my corn crop. I did better than most because my lower acres received enough rain. Others didn&#x2019;t. Never saw anything like it. On one side of the road the corn would be twisted right up, and on the other just as plump as you&#x2019;d please. The corn behind the old schoolhouses looks poorly.&#x201d;<br><br>Hester jumped in. &#x201c;Government&#x2019;s fault. All that stuff they have circling around up there in space. Gotta affect us.&#x201d;<br><br>Both Harry and Buddy nodded politely, for Hester was a little in space herself. Sometimes a lot out there. Middle-�aged, good-�looking, with glossy light brown hair hanging to her shoulders, she applied just enough makeup to draw attention to her symmetry and health. Every small town as well as big city has its Hesters, it&#x2019;s just they can&#x2019;t hide in the small towns. Good-�looking people, often bright, but they don&#x2019;t quite fit in and often they never marry. Hester had gone to Mary Baldwin, excelled in her studies, but came back over the Blue Ridge Mountains to run this roadside stand. Her brother, more ambitious, moved to Houston right out of the College of William and Mary. He had perfect timing, hitting Texas on the cusp of a building boom and making the most of it. Her parents had built the stand more as a hobby than a business, but it flourished. Her father had been a banker; her mother had run the stand. These days Hester seemed happy enough, engaged with a steady stream of regulars and tourists.<br><br>Buddy kindly semi-�agreed. &#x201c;What scares me is what we don&#x2019;t know. I mean, just in general, look at this drought and, hey, we came out a lot better off than they did in the Midwest, where everything burned up. Right now our water table is good. I planted more Silver Queen corn because I think the weather will stay warm longer. I&#x2019;ll get it harvested and if not, I&#x2019;ll make a lot of critters happy.&#x201d; He let out a booming laugh.<br><br>Hester asked, &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got crop coverage, Buddy? After the drought of 1988, surely you started paying for an insurance policy, revenue protection.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I do. I elected an eighty percent revenue protection policy. Yes, I did learn from 1988 but, girl, every time I turn around I&#x2019;m writing another check and I see my return diminish. Farming gets harder and harder,&#x201d; said the well-�organized man, a true steward of the land. &#x201c;Just to keep up, I have to plant more acreage. Plant an early crop, then come back and throw soybeans down. I feel like I&#x2019;m running to stay in place.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Think we all do,&#x201d; Hester agreed.<br><br>&#x201c;Only way I can buy or rent&#x2014;�and renting makes sense in the short term&#x2014;�is to sell some of my land closer in to Crozet or Charlottesville.&#x201d;<br><br>Hester&#x2019;s shoulders snapped back. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do that, Buddy. Don&#x2019;t ever do that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Before I forget, Hester, do you have any pattypan squash?&#x201d; Harry didn&#x2019;t want to keep Fair or the arguing animals in limbo.<br><br>&#x201c;I do. Wait until you see it.&#x201d; Hester nodded to Buddy, who winked at Harry.<br><br>The two women walked inside, where there was crooknecked squash, acorn squash, and Harry&#x2019;s favorite, cream-�white pattypan squash that looked like scalloped discuses.<br><br>&#x201c;Beautiful! And the right size.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right about now the pattypan is usually over, but this year with the long, long summer, I&#x2019;m still getting some,&#x201d; said Hester. &#x201c;The melons are over, though. I do so love melons. Before I forget, now, you and Fair are buying tickets for the hayride. You must. The library is built but there&#x2019;s a lot to be done. We need $59,696 just for adult computers and, oh my, the adult area needs tables and we need furniture for a meditative reading room. The list is endless.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course we&#x2019;ll buy tickets. I&#x2019;ll even buy tickets for Mrs. Murphy, Pewter, and Tucker.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If that gray cat of yours gets any fatter, I&#x2019;ll have to find a special wagon and pony just for her.&#x201d; Hester laughed.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re looking pretty Halloweeny yourself, all orange and black.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, this is just my warm-�up. Next week I&#x2019;ll be out here in my witch&#x2019;s costume.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So long as you don&#x2019;t scare customers away.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I could be a Halloween fairy except I&#x2019;ve never seen a Halloween fairy.&#x201d;<br><br>They kept chatting as Harry picked out two succulent squashes, then paid at the cash register run by Lolly Currie, a young woman looking for a better job but making ends meet at Hester&#x2019;s stand until then.<br><br>Back on the road, Fair grinned. &#x201c;That is the shortest time you have ever spent at Martin&#x2019;s Stand.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Buddy Janss helped me out, because as soon as I paid for my squash, he came back to chat up Hester, about late produce deliveries. I swear, Buddy has put on more weight. His chins now have chins.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Buddy may be fat but he&#x2019;s light on his feet. He was a hell of a football player in high school and college. It&#x2019;s a pity that retired linemen run to fat so often.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Boxers, too.&#x201d; She watched rolling hills pass by.<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe you should go live with Buddy. The two of you could be Team Tubby.&#x201d; Tucker knew this would start a fight.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Mrs. Murphy counseled in vain.<br><br>&#x201c;Bubble Butt. Poop Breath!&#x201d; Pewter hissed loudly.<br><br>Harry twisted around in the front seat just in time to see Pewter hook the dog&#x2019;s shoulder with one claw.<br><br>&#x201c;Ouch,&#x201d; Tucker yelped.<br><br>&#x201c;Next, your eyes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Pull over, honey. There will be fur all over the car if I don&#x2019;t stop this right now.&#x201d;<br><br>He pulled over on the side of the road. The field on the north side of the two-�lane road was jammed with corn. Morrowdale Farm usually put these fields in good hay, but this year row after row of healthy corn filled them. They had somehow escaped the small drought.<br><br>Opening the door to again castigate the backseat passengers, Harry remarked, &#x201c;This has to be one of the best-�run and prettiest farms in Albemarle County.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sure is.&#x201d;<br><br>They looked out to the scarecrow in the middle of the field, currently being mobbed by crows.<br><br>&#x201c;I thought scarecrows were supposed to frighten crows,&#x201d; Fair said.<br><br>&#x201c;Those crows are having a party. Look at that. Pulling on the wig under the hat.&#x201d; Harry laughed. &#x201c;What are all those birds doing?&#x201d;<br><br>Fair stepped out of the car to stare intently as a crow plucked out an eyeball.<br><br>&#x201c;Honey, that&#x2019;s not a scarecrow.&#x201d;<br><br>2<br><br>&#x201c;Tucker, come back!&#x201d; Harry called to the corgi as the dog raced across the cornfield.<br><br>Fair, in his shock, hadn&#x2019;t closed the station wagon door, so all three animals had rushed out after deciding to see what was going on.<br><br>The corn rustled as the strong little dog bounded through.<br><br>The two cats also sped down a row, curiosity raging.<br><br>&#x201c;Selective hearing.&#x201d; Harry shook her head as she followed, starting into a corn row.<br><br>&#x201c;Honey, they&#x2019;ll be back. You should stay where you are, otherwise you might destroy footprints or some other kind of evidence.&#x201d;<br><br>She stopped, turned to face her husband. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure you want to see the corpse anyway.&#x201d;<br><br>Harry leaned up against the Volvo. &#x201c;Death really is ugly and this one is probably especially so. But, Fair, why truss someone up like a scarecrow?&#x201d;<br><br>He folded his arms across his chest. &#x201c;Clever, really. How many people passed by this field on Garth Road? Plenty, I bet, and still no one stopped or called the sheriff&#x2019;s department. The only reason we did was because of the ruckus raised by our passengers, and then the crows caught our eye, and . . . well.&#x201d;<br><br>As the married couple waited for the sheriff&#x2019;s department to arrive, the three investigating animals reached the base of the scarecrow.<br><br>A blue-�black crow perched on the straw hat looked down. &#x201c;Beat it!&#x201d; he squawked.<br><br>Mrs. Murphy knew she could climb the dead man&#x2019;s leg if need be, so she stood on her hind legs reaching far up, feeling the cold flesh under the faux scarecrow&#x2019;s pants. &#x201c;I can climb up and shoo all of you away,&#x201d; she threatened the birds.<br><br>A second crow in this mob, on an outstretched arm, gibed, &#x201c;Go ahead. We&#x2019;ll fly away, circle, and come right on back.&#x201d;<br><br>The first crow opened his wings to their full span, the light picking up the blue highlights. &#x201c;What do you want with this feast? Cats don&#x2019;t eat carrion.&#x201d;<br><br>Pewter ignored the question and asked one of her own: &#x201c;Did you see the scarecrow being set up?&#x201d;<br><br>The second crow spoke. &#x201c;No, but he hasn&#x2019;t been here long. We caught a whiff as we flew over this cornfield on our way to Shelford Farm. When we tear off a juicy piece of meat, some blood still drips.&#x201d;<br><br>Few scarecrows are well dressed. Neither was this one. It wore a drab, wrinkled shirt over a red undershirt. Worn, old pants, rope for a belt, took care of his bottom half. Old work boots, the sole separated from the left one, covered his feet. The straw hat, edges frayed, hatband missing, gave the fellow the final country touch.<br><br>As blood pools in the extremities, the crows provided valuable information. The scarecrow wouldn&#x2019;t show the signs of rigor mortis because the body was tied, arms outstretched, legs tied down, too. No blood was moving, the body temperature had cooled down, but this was a fresh kill, relatively.<br><br>Mrs. Murphy noticed that the eyes had been plucked out and a lot of flesh had already been eaten off his face and hands. Eventually, the crows would have torn through the clothing.</p><h2>The Legacy of Heorot</h2><p>Light years from Earth, on Tau Ceti Four, two hundred colonists have created a thriving community, not realizing that they have upset a delicate ecological balance and have unleashed an unbelievable nightmare</p><p><b>Larry Niven</b> is the multiple Hugo and Nebula Award-winning author of the 'Ringworld' series, as well as many other science fiction masterpieces.

They are caught in an overwhelming culture, but-like the speck-sized cellist of the last page-they move "towards a simpler world" through the music they make.

She was about to turn ninety and I hadn't seen her for nearly a decade. My brother, Dima, and I were her only family; her lone daughter, our mother, had died years earlier. Baba Seva lived alone now in her old Moscow apartment. When I called to tell her I was coming, she sounded very happy to hear it, and also a little confused.<br><br> My parents and my brother and I left the Soviet Union in 1981. I was six and Dima was sixteen, and that made all the difference. I became an American, whereas Dima remained essentially Russian. As soon as the Soviet Union collapsed, he returned to Moscow to make his fortune. Since then he had made and lost several fortunes; where things stood now I wasn't sure. But one day he Gchatted me to ask if I could come to Moscow and stay with Baba Seva while he went to London for an unspecified period of time.<br><br> "Why do you need to go to London?"<br><br> "I'll explain when I see you."<br><br> "You want me to drop everything and travel halfway across the world and you can't even tell me why?"<br><br> There was something petulant that came out of me when dealing with my older brother. I hated it, and couldn't help myself.<br><br> Dima said, "If you don't want to come, say so. But I'm not discussing this on Gchat."<br><br> "You know," I said, "there's a way to take it off the record. No one will be able to see it."<br><br> "Don't be an idiot."<br><br> He meant to say that he was involved with some very serious people, who would not so easily be deterred from reading his Gchats. Maybe that was true, maybe it wasn't. With Dima the line between those concepts was always shifting.<br><br> As for me, I wasn't really an idiot. But neither was I not an idiot. I had spent four long years of college and then eight much longer years of grad school studying Russian literature and history, drinking beer, and winning the Grad Student Cup hockey tournament (five times!); then I had gone out onto the job market for three straight years, with zero results. By the time Dima wrote me I had exhausted all the available post-graduate fellowships and had signed up to teach online sections in the university's new PMOOC initiative, short for "paid massive online open course," although the "paid" part mostly referred to the students, who really did need to pay, and less to the instructors, who were paid very little. It was definitely not enough to continue living, even very frugally, in New York. In short, on the question of whether I was an idiot, there was evidence on both sides. <br><br> Dima writing me when he did was, on the one hand, providential. On the other hand, Dima had a way of getting people involved in undertakings that were not in their best interests. He had once convinced his now former best friend Tom to move to Moscow to open a bakery. Unfortunately, Tom opened his bakery too close to another bakery, and was lucky to leave Moscow with just a dislocated shoulder. Anyway, I proceeded cautiously. I said, "Can I stay at your place?" Back in 1999, after the Russian economic collapse, Dima bought the apartment directly across the landing from my grandmother's, so helping her out from there would be easy.<br><br> "I'm subletting it," said Dima. "But you can stay in our bedroom in grandma's place. It's pretty clean."<br><br> "I'm thirty-three years old," I said, meaning too old to live with my grandmother.<br><br> "You want to rent your own place, be my guest. But it'll have to be pretty close to Grandma's."<br><br> Our grandmother lived in the center of Moscow. The rents there were almost as high as Manhattan's. On my PMOOC salary I would be able to rent approximately an armchair.<br><br> "Can I use your car?"<br><br> "I sold it."<br><br> "Dude. How long are you leaving for?"<br><br> "I don't know," said Dima. "And I already left."<br><br> "Oh," I said. He was already in London. He must have left in a hurry.<br><br> But I in turn was desperate to leave New York. The last of my old classmates from the Slavic department had recently left for a new job, in California, and my girlfriend of six months, Sarah, had recently dumped me at a Starbucks. "I just don't see where this is going," she had said, meaning I suppose our relationship, but suggesting in fact my entire life. And she was right: even the thing that I had once most enjoyed doing-reading and writing about and teaching Russian literature and history-was no longer any fun. I was heading into a future of halfheartedly grading the half-written papers of half-interested students, with no end in sight.<br><br> Whereas Moscow was a special place for me. It was the city where my parents had grown up, where they had met; it was the city where I was born. It was a big, ugly, dangerous city, but also the cradle of Russian civilization. Even when Peter the Great abandoned it for St. Petersburg in 1713, even when Napoleon sacked it in 1812, Moscow remained, as Alexander Herzen put it, the capital of the Russian people. "They recognized their ties of blood to Moscow by the pain they felt at losing it." Yes. And I hadn't been there in years. Over the course of a few grad-school summers I'd grown tired of its poverty and hopelessness. The aggressive drunks on the subway; the thugs in tracksuits and leather jackets walking around eyeing everyone; the guy eating from the dumpster next to my grandmother's place every night during the summer I spent there in 2000, periodically yelling "Fuckers! Bloodsuckers!" then going back to eating. I hadn't been back since.<br><br> Still, I kept my hands off the keyboard. I needed some kind of concession from Dima, if only for my pride.<br><br> I said, "Is there someplace for me to play hockey?" As my academic career had declined, my hockey playing had ramped up. Even during the summer, I was on the ice three days a week.<br><br> "Are you kidding?" said Dima. "Moscow is a hockey mecca. They're building new rinks all the time. I'll get you into a game as soon as you get here."<br><br> I took that in.<br><br> "Oh, and the wireless signal from my place reaches across the landing," Dima said. "Free wi-fi."<br><br> "OK!" I wrote.<br><br> "OK?"<br><br> "Yeah," I said. "Why not."<br><br> A few days later I went to the Russian consulate on the Upper East Side, stood in line for an hour with my application, and got a one-year visa. Then I wrapped things up in New York: I sublet my room to a rock drummer from Minnesota, returned my books to the library, and fetched my hockey stuff from a locker at the rink. It was all a big hassle, and not cheap, but I spent the whole time imagining the different life I would soon be living and the different person I'd become. I pictured myself carrying groceries for my grandmother; taking her on excursions around the city, including to the movies (she'd always loved the movies); walking with her arm in arm around the old neighborhood and listening to her tales of life under socialism. There was so much about her life that I didn't know, about which I'd never asked. I had been incurious and oblivious; I had believed more in books than I had in people. I pictured myself protesting the Putin regime in the morning, playing hockey in the afternoon, and keeping my grandmother company in the evening. Perhaps there was even some way I might use my grandmother's life as the basis for a journal article. I pictured myself sitting monastically in my room and with my grandmother's stories in hand adding a whole new dimension to my work. Maybe I could put her testimony in italics and intersperse it throughout my article, like in In Our Time.<br><br> On my last night in town my roommates threw me a small party. "To Moscow," they said, raising their cans of beer.<br><br> "To Moscow!" I repeated.<br><br> "And don't get killed," one of them added.<br><br> "I won't get killed," I promised. I was excited. And drunk. It occurred to me that there was a certain glamor that might attend spending time in an increasingly violent and dictatorial Russia-at that very moment bombing the small country of Georgia into submission. At three in the morning I sent a text message to Sarah. "I'm leaving tomorrow," it said, as if I were heading for a very dangerous place. Sarah did not respond. Three hours later I woke up, still drunk, threw the last of my stuff into my huge red suitcase, grabbed my hockey stick, and headed for JFK. I got on my flight and promptly fell asleep.<br><br> Next thing I knew I was standing in the passport control line in the grim basement of Sheremetevo-2 International Airport. It never seemed to change. As long as I'd been flying in here, they made you come down to this basement and wait in line before you got your bags. It was like a purgatory from which you suspected you might be entering someplace other than heaven.<br><br> But the Russians looked different than I remembered them. They were well dressed, with good haircuts, and talking on sleek new cell phones. Even the guards in their light-blue short-sleeve uniforms looked cheerful. Though the line was long, several stood off together to the side, laughing. Oil was selling at $114 a barrel, and their army had just won a short little war with Georgia-is that what they were laughing about?<br><br> Modernization theory said the following: Wealth and technology are more powerful than culture. Give people nice cars, color televisions, and the ability to travel to Europe, and they'll stop being so aggressive. No two countries with McDonald's franchises will ever go to war with each other. People with cell phones are nicer than people without cell phones.<br><br> I wasn't so sure. The Georgians had McDonald's, and the Russians bombed them anyway. As I neared the passport booth, a tall, bespectacled, nicely dressed European, Dutch or German, asked in English if he could cut the line: he had to catch a connecting flight. I nodded yes-we'd have to wait for our luggage anyway-but the man behind me, about the same height as the Dutch guy but much sturdier, in a boxy but not to my eyes inexpensive suit, piped up in Russian-accented English.<br><br> "Go back to end of line."<br><br> "I'm about to miss my flight," said the Dutchman.<br><br> "Go back to end of line."<br><br> I said to him in Russian, "What's the difference?"<br><br> "There's a big difference," he answered.<br><br> "Please?" the Dutchman asked again, in English.<br><br> "I said go back. Now." The Russian turned slightly so that he was square with the Dutchman. The latter man kicked his bag in frustration. Then he picked it up and walked to the back of the line.<br><br> "He made the correct decision," said the Russian guy to me, in Russian, indicating that as a man of principle he was ready to pummel the Dutch guy for cutting the line.<br><br> I didn't answer. A few minutes later, I approached the passport control booth. The young, blond, unsmiling border guard took my battered blue American passport-the passport of a person who lived in a country where you didn't have to carry your passport everywhere you went, where in fact you might not even know where your passport was for months and years at a time-with mild disgust. If he had a passport like mine he'd take better care of it. He checked my name against the terrorist database and buzzed me through the gate to the other side.<br><br> [AU/ED: with an American passport, would Andrei be on the same passport line as Russians? In many airports they separate them, yes?]<br><br> I was in Russia again.<br><br> My grandmother Seva lived in the very center of the city, in an apartment she�d been awarded, in the late 1940s, by Joseph Stalin. My brother, Dima, brought this up sometimes, when he was trying to make a point, and so did my grandmother, when she was in a self-deprecating mood. �My Stalin apartment,� she called it, as if to remind everyone, and herself, of the moral compromise she had made. Still, in general in our family it was understood that if someone was offering you an apartment, and you lived at the time in a drafty room in a communal apartment with your small daughter, your two brothers, and your mom, then you should take the apartment, no matter who it was from. And it�s not like Stalin himself was handing her the keys or asking for anything in return. She was at the time a young professor of history at Moscow State University, and had consulted on a film about Ivan the Great, the fifteenth-century �gatherer of the lands of Rus� and grandfather to Ivan the Terrible, which Stalin so enjoyed that he declared everyone involved should get an apartment. So in addition to �my Stalin apartment,� my grandmother also called it �my Ivan the Great apartment,� and then, if she was speaking honestly, �my Yolka apartment,� after her daughter, my mother, for whom she had been willing to do anything at all.<br><br> To get to this apartment I exchanged some dollars at the booth outside baggage claim-it was about twenty-four rubles per dollar at the time-and took the brand-new express train to Savelovsky Railway Station, passing miles of crumbling Soviet apartment blocks, and the old (also crumbling) turn-of-the-century industrial belt just outside the center. Along the way the massive guy sitting next to me-about my age, in jeans and a short-sleeve button-down-struck up a conversation.<br><br> "What model is that?" he asked, about my phone. I had bought a SIM card at the airport and was now putting it in the phone and seeing if it worked.<br><br> Here we go, I thought. My phone was a regular T-Mobile flip phone.But I figured this was just a prelude to the guy trying to rob me. I grew tense. My hockey stick was in the luggage rack above us, and anyway it would have been hard to swing it at this guy on this train.<br><br> "Just a regular phone," I said. "Samsung." I grew up speaking Russian and still speak it with my father and my brother but I have a slight, difficult-to-place accent. I occasionally make small grammatical mistakes or put the stress on the wrong syllable. And I was rusty.<br><br> The guy picked up on this, as well as the fact that my olive skin set me apart from most of the Slavs on this fancy train. "Where you from?" he said. He used the familiar ty rather than vy-which could mean he was being friendly, because we were the same age and on the same train, or it could mean he was asserting his right to call me anything he wanted. I couldn't tell. He began to guess where I might be from. "Spain?" he said. "Or Turkey?"</p><h2>Design Of Welded Structures</h2><p>Design of Welded Structures a textbook includes Welding Safety DVD and Welding Classroom resources DVD.

Able to walk between two worlds, he becomes not just Lord Greystoke but Tarzan of the Apes. In this beautiful hardcover edition, you will find the first three thrilling installments in Edgar Rice Burroughs&#39; landmark adventure. Tarzan of the Apes: A mutiny on board their ship leaves Lord and Lady Greystoke stranded on a desolate African beach with their newborn son. Soon after, the aristocratic couple perishes, leaving the boy an orphan--until the she-ape Kala rescues the infant, names him &#34;Tarzan&#34; (&#34;white skin&#34;), and raises him as one of her own. As he grows, Tarzan schools himself in the ways of both man and beast and rises to become king of the jungle. But when he falls in love with Jane Porter, a beautiful American explorer, he is forced to choose between the two very different worlds. The Return of Tarzan: The adventure continues across two continents as Tarzan travels back to England, where he becomes embroiled in royal intrigue and espionage. Later, returning to his African jungle home, he is proclaimed leader of the Waziri tribe--and told about a fabulous lost city full of treasure ruled by a beautiful priestess. The priestess falls in love with Tarzan, but he cares only for his fianc�e, the American beauty Jane Porter--and when she&#39;s kidnapped by a dangerous tribe of apelike men, Tarzan must use all his powers as king of the jungle to rescue her. Beasts of Tarzan: In this third thrilling installment in Edgar Rice Burroughs&#39;s perennially popular series, Tarzan is exiled on a wild island filled with dangers. There, he must enlist the help of a noble panther and a tribe of apes in order to return to the mainland and rescue his wife and infant son from the clutches of his nemesis, the villainous Nikolas Rokoff.</p><p></p><h2>Miss Julia Hits the Road</h2><p>Despite her increasing concerns at the exploits marking her boyfriend&#39;s mid-life crisis, sharp-tongued southerner Miss Julia launches a motorcycle fund-raiser to save her housekeeper&#39;s home from being lost to the schemes of a greedy landlord. 45,000 first printing.</p><p><p> Ann B. Ross holds a doctorate in English from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and has taught literature at the University of North Carolina in Asheville. She is the author of fourteen previous novels featuring the popular southern heroine Miss Julia. She lives in Hendersonville, North Carolina.</p> <p> <b>Watch an interview with Ann B. Ross:</b></p><p> <b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p> Pushing through the swinging door from the dining room, I started talking before I got into the kitchen good. "Lillian, I need to ask you something, and I want a serious answer. What in the world is wrong with Sam Murdoch?" </p><p> She turned away from the sink and squinched her eyes at me. "They's not one thing wrong with Mr. Sam. An' what I think, Miss Julia, is you ought not be pickin' on him." </p><p> "Well, he's acting strange, if you ask me." </p><p> She turned back to the sink, mumbling about not having heard anybody ask anybody. Lillian was bad to mumble under her breath whenever she disagreed with somebody, namely me. I didn't mind, though, since I'd been known to do a little mumbling myself on occasion. She'd been taking care of my house, my meals, and me for so long now that we pretty much knew what the other was thinking, whether we spoke up or not. And I knew she never liked hearing anything against Sam, which was why I hadn't brought up my concern about him before now. </p><p> "Lillian, please," I said, "Would you just come sit down and help me with this?" </p><p> "If you want these green beans for supper, you better let me finish stringin' 'em." "For goodness sakes, you can do it easier sitting down. Bring them over here and let me help you. </p><p> "Maybe the first thing I ought to do," I went on, as she brought the plastic bag of beans and the bowl of snapped ones to the table, "is ask what's wrong with you. I declare, Lillian, neither you nor Sam have been yourselves lately." </p><p> "I don't know nothin' 'bout Mr. Sam," she said, busying herself with spreading the morning's newspaper on the table. "He actin' like he always do, far's I can tell." </p><p> "No, he's not. You just don't know the half of it." I took a handful of beans and began stringing them on the newspaper. "He's been sending flowers, for one thing. Well, you've seen them. They're all over the house." </p><p> "That's 'cause he know you sad an' lonesome with Miss Hazel Marie and Little Lloyd gone to live with that Mr. Pickens. He know you miss 'em, an' he tryin' to cheer you up." </p><p> "That's probably true." I nodded in agreement. "But one arrangement and one potted plant would've been a gracious plenty for any cheering up he wanted to do." I dropped snapped pieces into the bowl and reached for another handful of beans. </p><p> "About the time one arrangement begins to wilt, here come two more. And the notes, </p><p> Lillian, you just haven't seen those notes." </p><p> "No'm, 'cause you won't let me." </p><p> "No, and I'm not going to. Or anybody else, for that matter. Embarrassing is what they are." </p><p> Lillian cut her eyes at me, then laughed in the old way, her gold tooth shining. It struck me that she'd done precious little laughing since Hazel Marie and Little Lloyd had packed most of their belongings and moved in with Mr. J. D. Pickens. Just to see if it'd work out, Hazel Marie'd said. Mr. Pickens was that private investigator I'd once hired, who set about winning Hazel Marie's heart without one word being said about making the situation legal. Except by me, who'd had plenty to say on the subject. Believe me, I won't ever employ a handsome man with a roving eye and an aversion to matrimony again. </p><p> "What them notes say?" Lillian asked. She got up to turn down the heat under the pot where she'd put a chunk of streak-of-lean on to boil. </p><p> "Never mind what they said. But you'd be worried about him, too, if you knew." I took a trembling breath, recalling some of the poetic passages that had accompanied the flowers, all in Sam's handwriting. "Then, Lillian, he calls me every day, just wanting to talk, he says. Now, you know how I hate talking on the telephone when nobody has anything to say. At all hours, too, as if some people aren't already in bed or busy with important matters." I stopped, then went on to tell it all. "And another thing. He drops by to see me without a by-your-leave or anything, just shows up right out of the blue. To see how I'm doing, he says. You've noticed that, Lillian, don't tell me you haven't." </p><p> "Yessum, I have. But you and Mr. Sam got so friendly at Miss Binkie and Coleman's weddin', I jus' figured things was pickin' up." </p><p> "What things are you talking about?" I demanded, readying myself to refute any assumptions she might have made. </p><p> "Well, you know. Maybe that weddin' put you in mind of another one." She came back to the table and started stringing green beans again, as innocent as you please. </p><p> "My Lord, Lillian, another wedding is the last thing on my mind." I said, throwing another handful of beans in the bowl. "Unless it's Hazel Marie's. Whoever heard of moving in with a man for a trial period, anyway?" </p><p> "Lots a people, that's who. An' it nobody's bus'ness but hers," Lillian reminded me, as she often did when she thought I was beginning to meddle. "Now, look like to me all Mr. Sam doin' is bein' nice and friendly." </p><p> I dropped the beans that were in my hand, and covered my face. "Oh, Lillian, it's not only what he says, but the way he says it. I don't know what he means, or if he means anything at all." </p><p> "I 'spect you figure it out, you put your mind to it." </p><p> I ignored that because, all along, I hadn't wanted to delve too deeply into what was behind Sam's unnerving attentions. Once burned, twice shy, you know, and after my previous less-than-satisfactory experience with a husband, I intended to steer clear of another one. </p><p> I propped my chin on my hand, my elbow on the table, and put the focus back on Sam where it belonged. "I'm afraid something's wrong with him, Lillian, and that's the truth of the matter. The way he's acting is just not like him. You know how he is. Usually, that is. So polite, so much of a gentleman, courtly even, and now ..." I lifted my head as a sudden thought came to me. "You know who he reminds me of? Mr. Pickens, that's who. He flirts, Lillian, and says the most outrageous things you've ever heard." </p><p> "That don't sound so bad to me." </p><p> "But it's not like Sam! I tell you the truth, I think he's entering his second childhood. He's old, you know." </p><p> "Not much older'n you," Lillian reminded me. I glared at her. "Age affects different people in different ways. You won't catch me wearing cowboy boots and blue jeans and whispering things in somebody's ear." </p><p> "Wouldn't hurt you to try; might even do you some good. Seem like to me you be noticin' you not gettin' any younger. I know lots a ladies be real happy to have a well-set-up man like Mr. Sam whisperin' in they ear. You keep on like you doin' an' he gonna turn his eye somewheres else." </p><p> I blew out my breath in exasperation. "Don't get me started on all the widows in this town who'd do anything in the world just to get married again. I know how they carry on. Just as soon as somebody's wife dies, there they are with casseroles and cakes and pies and invitations to dinner. I tell you, they don't know when they're well off." </p><p> "Lemme get these beans on," she said, pushing herself up from the table and carrying the bowl to the stove. "This meat done boiled down enough." </p><p> "You're not helping me, Lillian. I'm really worried about him. At first I thought he was suffering a midlife crisis, except he's too old. Maybe he's getting senile." </p><p> "Well, which is it? He in his chilehood or his old age?" </p><p> "I don't know," I said, slumping back in my chair. "And to tell the truth, I don't know which would be worse." </p><p> A sudden whining and growling began building up from out on the street and, as I jerked upright, the racket seemed to fill the whole room. "What in the world is that?" I started out of my chair as the commotion got louder and louder, and nearer and nearer. Clamping my hands over my ears, I ran to the window. Lillian dumped the beans in the pot and slung the bowl on the counter. As she hurried to the window beside me, my first thought was that a swarm of hornets had nested in my front yard, ruining my boxwoods. </p><p> Realizing that we couldn't see from the kitchen window, Lillian and I pushed and shoved each other in our hurry to get through the house to the front door. The clattering, rumbling din was painful to hear as we got closer to it. </p><p> "What is it? What is it?" I gasped as we both reached for the door knob, our hands fumbling for purchase. </p><p> "Oh, my Jesus!" Lillian cried, her voice cracking as she panted for breath. "It's the Rapture! Here I am, sweet Jesus, I'm a comin'!" </p><p> "Lillian, for goodness sakes. Get hold of yourself and get this door open." She took a deep breath and came down to earth. "Maybe a UFO's squattin' down out there." </p><p> Before I could say what I thought of that, she pushed my hand aside, got the knob turned, and opened the door. When we rushed out onto the porch, I'd have opted for any kind of flying object other than the one that greeted our eyes. A rumbling, whining, two-wheeled machine slued out of my yard onto Polk Street, then swung wildly around the street and headed back into my driveway, sideswiping the plastic roll-out trash container perched on the sidewalk. Then, weaving up the driveway, it sliced through a pile of leaves, sending them swirling and scattering in the air. As we watched, open-mouthed, the loud, grumbling thing took its rider between two boxwoods, grazed the limbs of a crepe myrtle, and chewed up my grass as it skidded in a mighty half-circle before coming to rest in the middle of my yard. </p><p> "My Lord," I gasped, taking a firm grip on Lillian's arm. "Who's driving that thing?" </p><p> "Look like it drivin' itself," Lillian said. </p><p> As the machine whined down, it gave off a few nerve-shattering pops and backfires. A black leather-clad figure swung a leg off the pile of steel, chrome and exhaust pipes, kicked down the kickstand, and turned to face us. </p><p> At least, I guessed he was facing us, for his head was encased in what looked like a shiny black bowling ball with a dark visor. Removing the black gloves, the figure creaked and squeaked its way toward the porch, steel-toed boots clanking on my concrete walk. </p><p> "Is that Mr. Pickens, Lillian?" I asked, trying to peer past the black face-covering. "Is that who it is?" </p><p> "No'm, I don' think so. This 'un not as spry as Mr. Pickens." ...</p></p><h2>Bad Or, the Dumbing of America</h2><p>A satirical reference work identifies and stigmatizes various contemporary examples of public relations attempts to make unnecessary--or downright bad--products seem necessary, discussing banks, restaurants, and canned music</p><p>From Fussell, a great crying out at just about everything that's awful about today's America. Bad things have always been around--cheap, false, deceitful; but when, as in our deluded ``age of hype,'' these things are not just swallowed whole but are declared to be ``better than any other sort,'' then ``bad'' is raised to ``BAD,'' otherwise understood as the culture-wide ``manipulation of fools by knaves'' that makes up the reality of our everyday experience in a nation that's insecure, ``subadult,'' and ``intellectually deprived.'' Fussell (Wartime, 1989, etc.) chronicles the shabby charade that comprises life in America, organizing his laments into a bitterly hilarious reference book with entries from ``BAD Advertising'' through ``BAD Television,'' with stops in between, for example, at airlines, beliefs, conversation, engineering, language, people, poetry, and even restaurants. The key idea throughout is that what determines true ``BAD'' is ``the distance between appearance and reality,'' and what Fussell is really decrying is the class insecurity, the ``doltishness and provincialism,'' that causes Americans to love the third-rate and to have not a clue as to the genuine. ``BAD Colleges and Universities'' may be the central entry in the whole, since wholesale and happily complacent ignorance lies at the heart of the horror. Out-Menckening Mencken in his silver-tongued diatribes at bunkum and pretense and fraud, Fussell slips sometimes into mere disgust, or worse, into plain insensitivity (West Virginia is a place where the waitresses ``will have no teeth''); but in declaring America to be a clownish nation empowered today only by ``a conspiracy against actuality,'' he addresses what might just be the awful truth about the last rotting timber our house stands on. With droll and despondently elegant wit, a study of the manipulated ignorance of our mass culture, and a dirge for the ``wiping-out of the amenity and nuance and complexity and charm that make a country worth living in.'' Domestic--and invaluable- -Fussell. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>This book is a lethal weapon. With deadly wit and a nose for fakery, Fussell ( Class ) takes aim at things promoted as highly desirable that are, in fact, phony, vacant, stupid, boring or subadult. He defines such trumpery as "bad," and finds examples of badness everywhere--in People magazine, pretentious language, "New Age" charlatans, show biz, "socko-erotic" poetry, all advertising, Edward Kennedy, George Bush, the Vietnam War and music like Ravel's Bolero, for starters. The acid mini-essays are arranged in A-to-Z format, followed by Fussell's diagnosis of badness as a misguided quest for the illusion of distinction and value in a rootless America progressively sinking into stupidity and ignorance. This delightfully wicked satire will produce many red faces. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Henry Moore&#39;s Sheep Sketchbook</h2><p>In 1972, when the packing and crating for a major exhibition made it impossible for him to work in his sculpture studios, Henry Moore retreated to a small studio that looks out on a sheep meadow. Over the course of several months, as sheep were suckled and sheared, Moore produced this delightful flock of sketches and drawings. Sheep are as much a commonplace of the English countryside as hedgerows, but Moore looked at them afresh. Here are ewes nurturing their lambs, lambs playing in the meadow, and the swollen stateliness of sheep with full coats of wool. Many of the sketches evoke themes that are important in all Moore&#39;s work. The depiction of a ewe and lamb, for instance, suggests the mother-and-child theme often evoked in Moore&#39;s sculpture by a large form sheltering a smaller one. Henry Moore presented the sketchbook to his daughter, Mary. In this facsimile edition, first created under Moore&#39;s personal supervision, Mary&#39;s little lambs will charm anyone who sees these tender, vigorous drawings.</p><p>Henry Moore (1898-1986) was perhaps the foremost sculptor of the 20th century. The late Lord Clark of Saltwood was famous for his work as a historian and populariser of the arts, especially as the presenter and writer of the TV series Civilisation (1969) and as director of the National Gallery.</p><h2>Amongst women</h2><p>Moran is an old Republican, a veteran of the Irish Civil War. He is dominated by his daughters who revive the custom of celebrating Monaghan Day. It is through their lives that we discover the story of his life. This book was shortlisted for the Booker Prize 1990. The author also wrote &#34;The Dark&#34;.</p><p>John McGahern was born in Dublin and brought up in the west of Ireland. He is the author of three collections of short stories and six novels, including <b>Amongst Women</b>, which was shortlisted for the Booker Prize.A lyric lament for Ireland, McGahern's lovingly observed family drama is dominated by an almost pathetic paterfamilias. Gruff, blustering Michael Moran, former guerrilla hero in the Irish War of Independence, is a man "in permanent opposition." Now a farmer, he vents his compulsion to dominate, his cold fury and sense of betrayal on his three teenage daughters. Yearning for approval but fearing his flare-ups, they periodically beat a path back to the farmhouse from London and Dublin, then take flight again, both proud and dependent. Moran's second wife, Rose, much younger than he, displays saintly patience in her attempts to heal this splintering family. Moran also claims a renegade son in London who is "turning himself into a sort of Englishman," and another son driven away by Moran's threats of beatings. McGahern ( The Dark ; The Pornographer ) has crafted a wise and tender novel whose brooding hero seems emblematic of an Ireland that drives away its sons and daughters. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Charleston</h2><p>The author of On Secret Service follows the experiences of an aristocratic family from the turbulent antebellum years through the Civil War, during which they harbor dark secrets and jealously guard their privilege and power. 150,000 first printing.</p><p>Though at times a historically illuminating work, <i>Charleston</i>, bestselling author John Jakes's fictional retelling of the title city's early history through the Civil War, remains a largely uninspiring drama. <i>Charleston</i> offers an account of the burgeoning city from the perspective of the fictional Bell family, whose British immigrant predecessors arrive in Charleston in 1720. The story of the family's lasting, influential link to Charleston begins with Edward, whose political ideas during the Revolution put him at odds with the town's largely loyalist population, including his brother Adrian. Edward fights bravely in the Revolution, joining an effective band of hit-and-run fighters, but is later murdered by a jilted, mentally ill lover. <i>Charleston</i> then leaps forward, following the fortunes of Edward's granddaughter, Alex, who adopts Edward's liberal, abolitionist views, and begins a romance with lifelong black friend Henry. As slave-revolt paranoia heightens in the South, Alex watches Charleston become an isolated, violent police state, and eventually travels north, becoming a songwriter for the abolitionists and a witness to Charleston's downfall. Jakes combines fictional characters with meticulously researched historical settings and figures to give the events of <i>Charleston</i> context, significance, and immediacy. But rather than relying on the simple power of history, Jakes distracts from the narrative with clumsy metaphors and exaggerated characters. <i>--Ross Doll</i>John Jakes is the author of fifteen consecutive <i>New York Times</i> bestselling novels, including <i>On Secret Service</i>, <i>American Dreams</i>, <i>Homeland</i>, <i>California Gold</i>, the <i>North and South</i> trilogy, and the <i>Kent Family Chronicles</i>.

The authors report the historical interpreations that differ from their own. In the end, a book is always written from the perspective from the author. Just as 5 people can see an auto accident and report 5 different accounts of what &#34;really happened&#34; we will always have many different interpretations of history, of the Bible, and of spiritual books that are not the Bible. Ultimately, we all can go into ourselves and connect with our own Guidance for the valid answers for ourselves. I enjoyed reading the &#34;channeled&#34; missing pages of the Gospel of Mary. Until the missing pages are found, these offer one possiblity of what is missing. There is much depth in the book siting Mary&#39;s connection to The Egyptians, the Essenes, Camelot, to Britian. There is even information to tie this to our chakras.

This year, however, the wind of unwelcome change is blowing, and Straitley is finally, reluctantly, contemplating retirement. As the new term gets under way, a number of incidents befall students and faculty alike, beginning as small annoyances but soon escalating in both number and consequence. St. Oswald's is unraveling, and only Straitley stands in the way of its ruin. But he faces a formidable opponent with a bitter grudge and a master strategy that has been meticulously planned to the final, deadly move. </p></p><p><p>Joanne Harris is the author of seven previous novels&#x2014;<em>Chocolat</em>, <em>Blackberry Wine</em>, <em>Five Quarters of the Orange</em>, <em>Coastliners</em>, <em>Holy Fools</em>, <em>Sleep</em>, <em>Pale Sister</em>, and <em>Gentlemen &amp; Players</em>; a short story collection, <em>Jigs &amp; Reels</em>; and two cookbook/memoirs, <em>My French Kitchen</em> and <em>The French Market</em>. Half French and half British, she lives in England.</p>Joanne Harris has left her very successful franchise of tales about magical French food for the austere world of a British "public" grammar school for boys, and she's made a stunning success of it. Her plot here consists of a cat-and-mouse game between a new teacher at upper-crust St. Oswald's, who for ancient reasons wants to destroy the school, and a very senior--some would say superannuated--Latin master who alone understands that there is a plot, not a series of unrelated catastrophes. Steven Pacey creates different, yet wholly believable, voices for the two narrators, who are 35 years apart in age and so deeply different psychologically that it's hard to believe it's one actor. A dazzling performance and wickedly good entertainment. B.G.

In seven accessible chapters, <i>Does America Need a Foreign Policy?</i> provides a crystalline assessment of how the United States' ascendancy as the world's dominant presence in the twentieth century may be effectively reconciled with the urgent need in the twenty-first century to achieve a bold new world order. With a new Afterword by the author that addresses the situation in the aftermath of September 11, <i>Does America Need a Foreign Policy?</i> asks and answers the most pressing questions of our nation today.</p><p>Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger asks a question in the title of his book <i>Does America Need a Foreign Policy?</i>--but there's really no doubt about the answer. That's not to say it shouldn't be asked: "The last presidential election was the third in a row in which foreign policy was not seriously discussed by the candidates," writes Kissinger. "In the face of perhaps the most profound and widespread upheavals the world has ever seen, [the United States] has failed to develop concepts relevant to the emerging realities." Kissinger tours the world in this book, describing how the United States should relate to various regions and countries. This is not a gripping book, but it is sober, accessible, brief, and comprehensive--and an excellent introduction to international relations and diplomacy. <p> Kissinger has opinions on just about every topic he raises, from globalization (for it) to international courts (against them, for the most part). He supports a vigorous missile-defense system: "The United States cannot condemn its population to permanent vulnerability." He opines on peace in the Middle East: "Israel should abandon its opposition to the creation of a Palestinian state except as part of a final status agreement." His claims are often eye-opening: "There are few nations in the world with which the United States has less reason to quarrel or more compatible interests than Iran." He is especially critical of domestic politics interfering with America's international relations: "Whatever the merit of the individual legislative actions, their cumulative effect drives American foreign policy toward unilateral and seemingly bullying conduct." The media has been a special problem in this regard, as it zips around the world in search of exciting but ephemeral stories, which are "generally presented as a morality play between good and evil having a specific outcome and rarely in terms of the long-range challenges of history." Does America need a foreign policy? Of course it does, and Henry Kissinger has done readers a service by outlining what a good one might be. <i>--John J. Miller</i></p>Henry Kissinger was the fifty-sixth Secretary of State. Born in Germany, Dr. Kissinger came to the United States in 1938 and was naturalized a US citizen in 1943. He served in the US Army and attended Harvard University, where he&nbsp;later became a member of the faculty.

1<br>Sanjaya<br>Your son Duryodhana, the king,<br><br>seeing the Pandava forces arrayed,<br><br>approached his teacher Drona<br><br>and spoke in command. 2<br>"My teacher, see<br><br>the great Pandava army arrayed<br><br>by Drupada's son,<br><br>your pupil, intent on revenge. 3<br>Here are heroes, mighty archers<br><br>equal to Bhima and Arjuna in warfare,<br><br>Yuyudhana, Virata, and Drupada,<br><br>your sworn foe on his great chariot. 4<br>Here too are Dhrishtaketu, Cekitana,<br><br>and the brave king of Benares;<br><br>Purujit, Kuntibhoja,<br><br>and the manly king of the Shibis. 5<br><br>Yudhamanyu is bold,<br><br>and Uttamaujas is brave;<br><br>the sons of Subhadra and Draupadi<br><br>all command great chariots. 6<br>Now, honored priest, mark<br><br>the superb men on our side<br><br>as I tell you the names<br><br>of my army's leaders. 7<br>They are you and Bhishma,<br><br>Karna and Kripa, a victor in battles,<br><br>your own son Ashvatthama,<br><br>Vikarna, and the son of Somadatta. 8<br>Many other heroes also risk<br><br>their lives for my sake,<br><br>bearing varied weapons<br><br>and skilled in the ways of war. 9<br>Guarded by Bhishma, the strength<br><br>of our army is without limit;<br><br>but the strength of their army,<br><br>guarded by Bhima, is limited. 10<br>In all the movements of battle,<br><br>you and your men,<br><br>stationed according to plan,<br><br>must guard Bhishma well!" 11<br>Bhishma, fiery elder of the Kurus,<br><br>roared his lion's roar<br><br>and blew his conch horn,<br><br>exciting Duryodhana's delight. 12<br><br>Conches and kettledrums,<br><br>cymbals, tabors, and trumpets<br><br>were sounded at once<br><br>and the din of tumult arose. 13<br>Standing on their great chariot<br><br>yoked with white stallions,<br><br>Krishna and Arjuna, Pandu's son,<br><br>sounded their divine conches. 14<br>Krishna blew Pancajanya, won from a demon;<br><br>Arjuna blew Devadatta, a gift of the gods;<br><br>fierce wolf-bellied Bhima blew Paundra,<br><br>his great conch of the east. 15<br>Yudhishthira, Kunti's son, the king,<br><br>blew Anantavijaya, conch of boundless victory;<br><br>his twin brothers Nakula and Sahadeva<br><br>blew conches resonant and jewel toned. 16<br>The king of Benares, a superb archer,<br><br>and Shikhandin on his great chariot,<br><br>Drishtadyumna, Virata, and indomitable Satyaki,<br><br>all blew their conches. 17<br>Drupada, with his five grandsons,<br><br>and Subhadra's strong-armed son,<br><br>each in his turn blew<br><br>their conches, O King. 18<br>The noise tore the hearts<br><br>of Dhritarashtra's sons,<br><br>and tumult echoed<br><br>through heaven and earth. 19<br><br>Arjuna, his war flag a rampant monkey,<br><br>saw Dhritarashtra's sons assembled<br><br>as weapons were ready to clash,<br><br>and he lifted his bow. 20<br>He told his charioteer:<br><br>"Krishna,<br><br>halt my chariot<br><br>between the armies! 21<br>Far enough for me to see<br><br>these men who lust for war,<br><br>ready to fight with me<br><br>in the strain of battle. 22<br>I see men gathered here,<br><br>eager to fight,<br><br>bent on serving the folly<br><br>of Dhritarashtra's son." 23<br>When Arjuna had spoken,<br><br>Krishna halted<br><br>their splendid chariot<br><br>between the armies. 24<br>Facing Bhishma and Drona<br><br>and all the great kings,<br><br>he said, "Arjuna, see<br><br>the Kuru men assembled here!" 25<br>Arjuna saw them standing there:<br><br>fathers, grandfathers, teachers,<br><br>uncles, brothers, sons,<br><br>grandsons, and friends. 26<br><br>He surveyed his elders<br><br>and companions in both armies,<br><br>all his kinsmen<br><br>assembled together. 27<br>Dejected, filled with strange pity,<br><br>he said this:<br><br>"Krishna, I see my kinsmen<br><br>gathered here, wanting war. 28<br>My limbs sink,<br><br>my mouth is parched,<br><br>my body trembles,<br><br>the hair bristles on my flesh. 29<br>The magic bow slips<br><br>from my hand, my skin burns,<br><br>I cannot stand still,<br><br>my mind reels. 30<br>I see omens of chaos,<br><br>Krishna; I see no good<br><br>in killing my kinsmen<br><br>in battle. 31<br>Krishna, I seek no victory,<br><br>or kingship or pleasures.<br><br>What use to us are kingship,<br><br>delights, or life itself? 32<br>We sought kingship, delights,<br><br>and pleasures for the sake of those<br><br>assembled to abandon their lives<br><br>and fortunes in battle. 33<br><br>They are teachers, fathers, sons,<br><br>and grandfathers, uncles, grandsons,<br><br>fathers and brothers of wives,<br><br>and other men of our family. 34<br>I do not want to kill them<br><br>even if I am killed, Krishna;<br><br>not for kingship of all three worlds,<br><br>much less for the earth! 35<br>What joy is there for us, Krishna,<br><br>in killing Dhritarashtra's sons?<br><br>Evil will haunt us if we kill them,<br><br>though their bows are drawn to kill. 36<br>Honor forbids us to kill<br><br>our cousins, Dhritarashtra's sons;<br><br>how can we know happiness<br><br>if we kill our own kinsmen? 37<br>The greed that distorts their reason<br><br>blinds them to the sin they commit<br><br>in ruining the family, blinds them<br><br>to the crime of betraying friends. 38<br>How can we ignore the wisdom<br><br>of turning from this evil<br><br>when we see the sin<br><br>of family destruction, Krishna? 39<br>When the family is ruined,<br><br>the timeless laws of family duty<br><br>perish; and when duty is lost,<br><br>chaos overwhelms the family. 40<br><br>In overwhelming chaos, Krishna,<br><br>women of the family are corrupted;<br><br>and when women are corrupted,<br><br>disorder is born in society. 41<br>This discord drags the violators<br><br>and the family itself to hell;<br><br>for ancestors fall when rites<br><br>of offering rice and water lapse. 42<br>The sins of men who violate<br><br>the family create disorder in society<br><br>that undermines the constant laws<br><br>of caste and family duty. 43<br>Krishna, we have heard<br><br>that a place in hell<br><br>is reserved for men<br><br>who undermine family duties. 44<br>I lament the great sin<br><br>we commit when our greed<br><br>for kingship and pleasures<br><br>drives us to kill our kinsmen. 45<br>If Dhritarashtra's armed sons<br><br>kill me in battle when I am unarmed<br><br>and offer no resistance,<br><br>it will be my reward." 46<br>Saying this in the time of war,<br><br>Arjuna slumped into the chariot<br><br>and laid down his bow and arrows,<br><br>his mind tormented by grief. 47<br>THE SECOND TEACHING<br>PHILOSOPHY AND<br><br>SPIRITUAL DISCIPLINE<br>Sanjaya<br>Arjuna sat dejected,<br><br>filled with pity,<br><br>his sad eyes blurred by tears.<br><br>Krishna gave him counsel. 1<br>Lord Krishna<br>Why this cowardice<br><br>in time of crisis, Arjuna?<br><br>The coward is ignoble, shameful,<br><br>foreign to the ways of heaven. 2<br>Don't yield to impotence!<br><br>It is unnatural in you!<br><br>Banish this petty weakness from your heart.<br><br>Rise to the fight, Arjuna! 3<br>Arjuna<br>Krishna, how can I fight<br><br>against Bhishma and Drona<br><br>with arrows<br><br>when they deserve my worship? 4<br><br>It is better in this world<br><br>to beg for scraps of food<br><br>than to eat meals<br><br>smeared with the blood<br><br>of elders I killed<br><br>at the height of their power<br><br>while their goals<br><br>were still desires. 5<br>We don't know which weight<br><br>is worse to bear--<br><br>our conquering them<br><br>or their conquering us.<br><br>We will not want to live<br><br>if we kill<br><br>the sons of Dhritarashtra<br><br>assembled before us. 6<br>The flaw of pity<br><br>blights my very being;<br><br>conflicting sacred duties<br><br>confound my reason.<br><br>I ask you to tell me<br><br>decisively--Which is better?<br><br>I am your pupil.<br><br>Teach me what I seek! 7<br>I see nothing<br><br>that could drive away<br><br>the grief<br><br>that withers my senses;<br><br>even if I won kingdoms<br><br>of unrivaled wealth<br><br>on earth<br><br>and sovereignty over gods. 8<br>Sanjaya<br>Arjuna told this<br><br>to Krishna--then saying,<br><br>"I shall not fight,"<br><br>he fell silent. 9<br>Mocking him gently,<br><br>Krishna gave this counsel<br><br>as Arjuna sat dejected,<br><br>between the two armies. 10<br>Lord Krishna<br>You grieve for those beyond grief,<br><br>and you speak words of insight;<br><br>but learned men do not grieve<br><br>for the dead or the living. 11<br>Never have I not existed,<br><br>nor you, nor these kings;<br><br>and never in the future<br><br>shall we cease to exist. 12<br>Just as the embodied self<br><br>enters childhood, youth, and old age,<br><br>so does it enter another body;<br><br>this does not confound a steadfast man. 13<br>Contacts with matter make us feel<br><br>heat and cold, pleasure and pain.<br><br>Arjuna, you must learn to endure<br><br>fleeting things--they come and go! 14<br>When these cannot torment a man,<br><br>when suffering and joy are equal<br><br>for him and he has courage,<br><br>he is fit for immortality. 15<br><br>Nothing of nonbeing comes to be,<br><br>nor does being cease to exist;<br><br>the boundary between these two<br><br>is seen by men who see reality. 16<br>Indestructible is the presence<br><br>that pervades all this;<br><br>no one can destroy<br><br>this unchanging reality. 17<br>Our bodies are known to end,<br><br>but the embodied self is enduring,<br><br>indestructible, and immeasurable;<br><br>therefore, Arjuna, fight the battle! 18<br>He who thinks this self a killer<br><br>and he who thinks it killed,<br><br>both fail to understand;<br><br>it does not kill, nor is it killed. 19<br>It is not born,<br><br>it does not die;<br><br>having been,<br><br>it will never not be;<br><br>unborn, enduring,<br><br>constant, and primordial,<br><br>it is not killed<br><br>when the body is killed. 20<br>Arjuna, when a man knows the self<br><br>to be indestructible, enduring, unborn,<br><br>unchanging, how does he kill<br><br>or cause anyone to kill? 21<br>As a man discards<br><br>worn-out clothes<br><br>to put on new<br><br>and different ones,<br><br>so the embodied self<br><br>discards<br><br>its worn-out bodies<br><br>to take on other new ones. 22<br>Weapons do not cut it,<br><br>fire does not burn it,<br><br>waters do not wet it,<br><br>wind does not wither it. 23<br>It cannot be cut or burned;<br><br>it cannot be wet or withered;<br><br>it is enduring, all-pervasive,<br><br>fixed, immovable, and timeless. 24<br>It is called unmanifest,<br><br>inconceivable, and immutable;<br><br>since you know that to be so,<br><br>you should not grieve! 25<br>If you think of its birth<br><br>and death as ever-recurring,<br><br>then too, Great Warrior,<br><br>you have no cause to grieve! 26<br>Death is certain for anyone born,<br><br>and birth is certain for the dead;<br><br>since the cycle is inevitable,<br><br>you have no cause to grieve! 27<br>Creatures are unmanifest in origin,<br><br>manifest in the midst of life,<br><br>and unmanifest again in the end.<br><br>Since this is so, why do you lament? 28<br>Rarely someone<br><br>sees it,<br><br>rarely another<br><br>speaks it,<br><br>rarely anyone<br><br>hears it--<br><br>even hearing it,<br><br>no one really knows it. 29<br>The self embodied in the body<br><br>of every being is indestructible;<br><br>you have no cause to grieve<br><br>for all these creatures, Arjuna! 30<br>Look to your own duty;<br><br>do not tremble before it;<br><br>nothing is better for a warrior<br><br>than a battle of sacred duty. 31<br>The doors of heaven open<br><br>for warriors who rejoice<br><br>to have a battle like this<br><br>thrust on them by chance. 32<br>If you fail to wage this war<br><br>of sacred duty,<br><br>you will abandon your own duty<br><br>and fame only to gain evil. 33<br>People will tell<br><br>of your undying shame,<br><br>and for a man of honor<br><br>shame is worse than death. 34<br><br>The great chariot warriors will think<br><br>you deserted in fear of battle;<br><br>you will be despised<br><br>by those who held you in esteem. 35<br>Your enemies will slander you,<br><br>scorning your skill<br><br>in so many unspeakable ways--<br><br>could any suffering be worse? 36<br>If you are killed, you win heaven;<br><br>if you triumph, you enjoy the earth;<br><br>therefore, Arjuna, stand up<br><br>and resolve to fight the battle! 37<br>Impartial to joy and suffering,<br><br>gain and loss, victory and defeat,<br><br>arm yourself for the battle,<br><br>lest you fall into evil. 38<br>Understanding is defined in terms of philosophy;<br><br>now hear it in spiritual discipline.<br><br>Armed with this understanding, Arjuna,<br><br>you will escape the bondage of action. 39<br>No effort in this world<br><br>is lost or wasted;<br><br>a fragment of sacred duty<br><br>saves you from great fear. 40<br>This understanding is unique<br><br>in its inner core of resolve;<br><br>diffuse and pointless are the ways<br><br>irresolute men understand. 41<br>Undiscerning men who delight<br><br>in the tenets of ritual lore<br><br>utter florid speech, proclaiming,<br><br>"There is nothing else!" 42<br><br>Driven by desire, they strive after heaven<br><br>and contrive to win powers and delights,<br><br>but their intricate ritual language<br><br>bears only the fruit of action in rebirth. 43<br>Obsessed with powers and delights,<br><br>their reason lost in words,<br><br>they do not find in contemplation<br><br>this understanding of inner resolve. 44<br>Arjuna, the realm of sacred lore<br><br>is nature--beyond its triad of qualities,<br><br>dualities, and mundane rewards,<br><br>be forever lucid, alive to your self. 45<br>For the discerning priest,<br><br>all of sacred lore<br><br>has no more value than a well<br><br>when water flows everywhere. 46<br>Be intent on action,<br><br>not on the fruits of action;<br><br>avoid attraction to the fruits<br><br>and attachment to inaction! 47<br>Perform actions, firm in discipline,<br><br>relinquishing attachment;<br><br>be impartial to failure and success--<br><br>this equanimity is called discipline. 48<br>Arjuna, action is far inferior<br><br>to the discipline of understanding;<br><br>so seek refuge in understanding--pitiful<br><br>are men drawn by fruits of action. 49<br><br>Disciplined by understanding,<br><br>one abandons both good and evil deeds;<br><br>so arm yourself for discipline--<br><br>discipline is skill in actions. 50<br>Wise men disciplined by understanding<br><br>relinquish the fruit born of action;<br><br>freed from these bonds of rebirth,<br><br>they reach a place beyond decay. 51<br>When your understanding passes beyond<br><br>the swamp of delusion,<br><br>you will be indifferent to all<br><br>that is heard in sacred lore. 52<br>When your understanding turns<br><br>from sacred lore to stand fixed,<br><br>immovable in contemplation,<br><br>then you will reach discipline. 53<br>Arjuna<br>Krishna, what defines a man<br><br>deep in contemplation whose insight<br><br>and thought are sure? How would he speak?<br><br>How would he sit? How would he move? 54<br>Lord Krishna<br>When he gives up desires in his mind,<br><br>is content with the self within himself,<br><br>then he is said to be a man<br><br>whose insight is sure, Arjuna. 55<br><br>When suffering does not disturb his mind,<br><br>when his craving for pleasures has vanished,<br><br>when attraction, fear, and anger are gone,<br><br>he is called a sage whose thought is sure. 56<br>When he shows no preference<br><br>in fortune or misfortune<br><br>and neither exults nor hates,<br><br>his insight is sure. 57<br>When, like a tortoise retracting<br><br>its limbs, he withdraws his senses<br><br>completely from sensuous objects,<br>...Text: English (translation)</p><h2>The shell: Five hundred million years of inspired design</h2><p>Beautiful collectors book with vivid pictures of seashells</p><p></p><h2>Whack Your Porcupine, and Other Drawings</h2><p>A collection of whacky cartoons, some in narrative sequence and some in broken series, poke and pummel convention, cliches, and contentions of the day</p><p></p><h2>Your Duck Is My Duck: Stories</h2><p><p><strong>A much-anticipated collection of brilliantly observant short stories from one of the great American masters of the form.</strong></p><p>At times raucously hilarious, at times charming and delightful, at times as solemn and mysterious as a pond at midnight, Deborah Eisenberg&#x2019;s stories gently compel us to confront the most disturbing truths about ourselves&#x2014;from our intimate lives as lovers, parents, and children, to our equally troubling roles as citizens on a violent, terrifying planet.</p><p>Each of the six stories in <em>Your Duck is My Duck</em>, her first collection since 2006, has the heft and complexity of a novel.

He has had simultaneous number-one bestsellers in hardcover and paperback, and many of his books have been made into successful movies, including The Eagle Has Landed, To Catch a King, On Dangerous Ground, Eye of the Storm, and Thunder Point. He has degrees in sociology, social psychology, and economics from the University of London, and a doctorate in media from Leeds Metropolitan University. A fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, and an expert scuba diver and marksman, Higgins lives in Jersey on the Channel Islands.An American colonel who knows the secrets of forthcoming D day has washed up, wounded, on the German-occupied island of Jersey, off the coast of England, and must be rescued. Thus the basic premise of Higgins's most tingling thriller since The Eagle Has Landed. An ex-philosophy don of part-German descent is assigned to effect the rescue, disguised as a special envoy of the dreaded Himmler and accompanied by his "mistress." Enmeshed in this complex situation are the activities of Rommel, who sends a Jewish actor (somewhat improbably, also a Wehrmacht corporal) to impersonate him on an "inspection tour" of Jersey's defenses, while he secretly meets with other top generals bent on assassinating the fuhrer. Caught up in the deadly game of "who's-fooling-whom and for how long?" are an amorous Italian count, a Finnish air ace and a hero of the Irish cause, while in the background loom Eisenhower and Hitler himself. Speed, surprise and suspense are Higgins's long suit, rather than convincing characterization, but engrossed readers are not likely to mind.

All you need is a heart that&#x2019;s in tune with the Holy Spirit and a willingness to venture out of your &#x201c;Circle of Comfort&#x201d; and into another person&#x2019;s life. Just Walk Across the Room brings personal evangelism into the twenty-first century. Building on the solid foundation laid in Becoming a Contagious Christian, Bill Hybels shows how you can participate in the model first set by Jesus, who stepped down from heaven 2,000 years ago to bring hope and redemption to broken people living in a fallen world. Now it&#x2019;s your turn. Your journey may not be as dramatic, but it can have a life-changing impact for someone standing a few steps away from you&#x2014;and for you as well, as you learn the power of extending care, compassion, and inclusiveness under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. The highest value in personal evangelism is cooperating with the Spirit, says Hybels. This means playing only the role you&#x2019;re meant to play&#x2014;walking when the Spirit says to walk, talking when he says to talk, and falling silent when he suggests that you&#x2019;ve said enough. Hybels encourages you to &#x201c;live in 3D&#x201d; ... Developing friendships Discovering stories Discerning appropriate next steps ... as a means of learning to understand the Holy Spirit&#x2019;s promptings. With fresh perspectives from his own reflections and experiences collected during his most recent decade of ministry, Bill Hybels shows with convincing and inspiring clarity the power of this personal, richly relational approach to evangelism. The stakes are high. The implications are eternal. And you may be only a conversation away from having an eternal impact on someone&#x2019;s life&#x2014;if you will just walk across the room.</p></p><p><p>Bill Hybels is the founding and senior pastor of Willow Creek Community Church in South Barrington, Ill., and chairman of the board for the Willow Creek Association.

The wide-eyed group sat with rapt attention as he delivered a few standing orders to be carried out until he returned. Remember what they were? &#39;Go out and train everyone you meet, far and near, in this way of life, marking them by baptism in the threefold name: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Then instruct them in the practice of all I have commanded you.&#39; Matthew 28:18 -- 20a, MSG Immediately after recognizing what&#39;s commonly referred to as the &#39;Great Commission,&#39; the next thought that crosses your mind (if you&#39;re like many Christians) is smothered with obligation . . . or worse yet, with guilt. I know I should be accomplishing the Great Commission, but I can&#39;t seem to get past that first word . . . Go. We go all the time. We go to work, go home, go out to eat, go shopping, go to sporting events, go to bed. But something deep inside us knows that Jesus&#39; &#39;go&#39; carries with it a very different connotation. His &#39;go&#39; means our feet have to get unstuck from where they&#39;re currently planted. It means we have to agree to action. It means we have to accept a little risk and stick one foot in front of the other to engage with another human being . . . having no idea where it all will lead. A daunting task for some, to say the least. Friends, if your desire to &#39;go&#39; and reach out to the people around you is strong, but you find yourself perpetually stuck in &#39;stay&#39; mode, this study is for you. Statistically, only 10 percent of any congregation would raise their hands if asked who has the formal gift of evangelism or who does any evangelizing on a regular basis. Which means there&#39;s a substantive number of believers sitting around you each weekend who are all locked up when it comes to pointing those outside the faith toward God. Just Walk Across the Room: The Four-Week Experience is a campaign designed to raise the value of evangelism for everyone in your church. This means that at the end of four weeks&#39; time, they will have a fresh understanding of what &#39;evangelism&#39; really means, as well as a dose of inspiration regarding how to get it done. In addition to having some unexpected fun this month, I think you&#39;ll come away from the experience anxious to &#39;go&#39; in ways you&#39;ve never before dreamed. One closing thought before you dive in: Jesus&#39; mountaintop speech to the disciples that day didn&#39;t end with his memorable series of commands. Probably detecting a little nervous energy in the audience, he concluded things with a single promise (and aren&#39;t we all glad!): &#39;I&#39;ll be with you as you do this, day after day after day, right up to the end of the age.&#39; Matthew 28:20b, MSG As you work through the material over the coming weeks, remember that evangelism isn&#39;t something you have to &#39;gear up&#39; for. Fundamentally, evangelism is about submitting to God&#39;s agenda in a social situation, in a conversation, in your moment-by-moment life. And, like Matthew&#39;s gospel says, he will be with you every step of the way. Bill Hybels Founding and Senior Pastor Willow Creek Community Church The Single Greatest Gift [Look to Jesus] Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. And being found in appearance as a human being, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death --- even death on a cross! Philipp ians 2:6 -- 8 Before You Meet 1. Read the introduction and chapters 1 and 2 in the Just Walk Across the Room hardcover book. 2. Complete the &#39;Simple Steps We All Can Take&#39; activity introduced during the weekend worship service (see page 10 for details). Note: If you are using this small group curriculum outside of the Just Walk Across the Room four-week campaign, simply disregard any item with a footprint symbol beside it. 3. Begin praying for one or two people for whom you want to take a &#39;walk across the room&#39; during this four-week experience. Beginning on page 69 of this participant&#39;s guide, you&#39;ll find space to log your prayer requests and the answers you receive. Simple Steps We All Can Take If you are a Christ-follower, consider how you wound up in the kingdom of God. Most likely, your story involves someone, somewhere who took a risk to walk across a room in order to point you toward faith. Maybe they extended a hand of friendship or engaged you in conversation. Regardless of the details, the end result was you submitting your life to God. If you still maintain contact with this person, then fill out and mail your &#39;God Used You to Help Point the Way&#39; note of gratitude to him or her today. If you&#39;re not in touch with this person any longer, you may instead choose to mail your card to someone who epitomizes what it means to be a walk-across-the-room person, actively living out their faith in their day-to-day lives. Big Idea --- The Single Greatest Gift The single greatest gift Christ-followers can give to the people around them is an introduction to the God who created them, who loves them, and who has a purpose for their lives. Nothing beats it --- not monetary gain, not job opportunities, not recognition or accolades. This is what evangelism is --- constantly watching for ways to give that gift to someone living far from God.

What part of Brian&#39;s story had the greatest impact on you? Please explain. 2. As you think back on your own journey toward God, who is the main person who &#39;took a walk&#39; for you? 3. How would you describe the way in which this person reached out to you? What part of that experience was most affirming or encouraging to you? 4.

Written for adults to read to children, the book encourages dialogue through the use of colorful illustrations, situations depicting symptoms, and interactive questions. Medical facts are provided at the end of each page to help readers answer children&#39;s questions with greater ease and specific terms are explained in the margin on each page.What makes this book different from other books on Parkinson&#39;s disease is that as a tool to enable children to understand what is wrong with their loved one with PD, there is nothing in the marketplace quite like it. Te book will very likely become &#39;the&#39; children&#39;s resource for information on Parkinson&#39;s disease.I&#39;ll Hold Your Hand So You Won&#39;t Fall: A Child&#39;s Guide to Parkinson&#39;s Diseaseis essential reading for children and families/caregivers with children that have relatives or loved ones suffering from Parkinson&#39;s</p><p>An Interview with Rasheda Ali <p>Q: What are the main reasons you decided to write a book on this subject? </p><p>I hope that this book will encourage families to work together as a team by providing patience, love, understanding, and encouragement to their loved ones who should never be in this struggle alone. There is currently no other publication in the marketplace that speaks to children in their own language along with colorful illustrations on the subject of Parkinson&#x2019;s disease. I&#x2019;ll Hold Your Hand So You Won&#x2019;t Fall: A Child&#x2019;s Guide to Parkinson&#x2019;s Disease is a book that can be read by adults to children or read alone by children. Adults will certainly glean information from it and in simple terms it will help to dispel myths and uncertainties that children may have when they see people with Parkinson&#x2019;s disease. </p><p>Q: How much experience do you have with Parkinson's disease to write a book about it? </p><p>A: My inspiration for writing a children's book about PD was triggered by my children's interaction with my dad and their questions. I have many friends who have PD and based on my experience with them and my dad, I developed a guide that adults can use when trying to explain to children why their loved ones with PD behave in a certain way. At first, I did not have the right words to explain it to them so I started to do my own research about the disease. I wanted to be well informed before I explained to them why their grandfather has PD. I also used a book my dad gave me for patients and families on the disease. It turned out that while trying to educate them about PD, I was also educating myself. Through real-life pictures and common symptoms of the illness, I thought that I could also reach out to families who were just as perplexed as I when my son asked me, "Why is Popi Shaking?" </p><p>Q: Does your Dad have any of the symptoms detailed in your book? </p><p>A: PD is a disease that is unique to each if its victims. Some may start out with Parkinson's syndrome and have it for a very long time then gradually develop PD. Its effect on each patient is individual. My dad has had PD for over 20 years and he has been fortunate not to have suffered some of the symptoms shown in the late stages of the disease. My dad has been blessed by being able to do all that he wants to do and that is travel, meet with masses of people, and sign autographs for millions of fans without much difficulty. </p><p>Q: Do you think boxing caused Parkinson's Disease in your dad? </p><p>A: No one knows how one gets Parkinson&#x2019;s disease. To date, there is no other boxer or athlete involved in contact sports of whom I am aware that has PD and therefore, the likelihood is slim. Research has proven that there could be a possible link between PD and certain environmental factors, such as certain pesticides that may trigger the disease. This is why PD is not a disease, which only affects the patient, but also affects the family. By funding research on Parkinson&#x2019;s disease, we could find what role toxins, viruses or bacteria, and aging have on PD. </p><p>Q: You mentioned in your book about Heredity with PD? What is the likelihood of you getting the disease or anyone in your family? </p><p>A: There is a section in my book entitled, "Genetics" where a young boy is illustrated wondering whether he will get Parkinson's disease just like his Grandma. Inheritance does not play a dominant role in Parkinson's. It does not typically run in families but there are some statistics. </p><p>Q: Does PD affect the patient's thinking processes? </p><p>A: PD is a chronic disease that affects the nervous system, which will get worse over time. The brain can be sharp and aware while the body may behave in an uncontrollable fashion. If you knew anyone with PD, you would see that they are the same person they always were but you might notice that they shake a little or speak very softly. As indicated in the book, by giving all those who suffer from PD their independence, you will help make them feel better about themselves. The whole family can take part to help their loved one feel more useful and less helpless. </p><p>Q: Has your dad ever considered undergoing the risky Deep Brain Stimulation Surgery? </p><p>A: Candidates for this type of surgery are Parkinson&#x2019;s disease patients that have severe tremors that cannot be controlled with medications, or dyskinesia, which is a side effect from certain drugs. I mention in the book to all caregivers, that one must choose a doctor specializing in PD and the patient must be evaluated only by a neurologist with expertise in this type of surgical procedure. Please use Parkinson&#x2019;s disease support groups and organizations available as a guide. Don't risk your loved one&#x2019;s life on inexperienced doctors. </p><p>Q: Does it frustrate you when you see your dad suffer from such an awful illness? </p><p>Your sympathy is misdirected. It should not be wasted on someone as fortunate as my dad. He has lived with PD for over 20 years and I believe because of his health, his positive mental outlook on life and his acceptance of the disease, he has been able to overcome the inconveniences of the illness with much success. My dad has done very well with PD. He has not suffered like many people I have seen during my research into the disease. </p><p>Q: What is the life expectancy for PD? </p><p>A: With proper treatment for the disease, the life expectancy and death rates are the same for PD patients as those without PD. </p><p>Q: What is your advice to those who have just found out they have PD? </p><p>A: First, I would say don&#x2019;t panic, you are not alone. My book gives advice to those living with PD and also to caregivers. I would first learn about the illness and then tell your loved ones about it. This book will help you explain the illness to your children or grandchildren.</p>Rasheda Ali is a tireless caregiver advocate on behalf of families who are fighting Parkinson&#39;s Disease.

This anthology contains writings from hundreds of women from the past five millennia and a wide range of cultures. The collection encompasses all areas of women's sacred experience from the most radically mystical encounters with the divine-including visions, locutions, and auditions-to simply daily awareness of the holy in all things.</p></p><p>The idea for assembling this outstanding anthology of <i>Sacred Voices</i> came to editor Mary Ford-Grabowsky while she was packing up her possessions for a move to a new household. Sorting through her stack of spiritually inspirational quotes written on Post-It notes, it suddenly occurred to her that almost all of the quotes were by men. "How could I have ignored the sacred wisdom of my own sex?" she asks. The answer, of course, is that it was an easy oversight considering the historical credence given to the masculine perspective of the divine over the earthier, fleshy, relationship-centered perspective of the feminine.<p>Thus began Ford-Grabowsky's quest to assemble an anthology of women's spiritual writing. "I had expected the spiritual beauty and tenderness, the love and quiet wisdom, but not the towering, tested, truly holy strength," writes Ford-Grabowsky, who took five years to gather this powerful collection. Those seeking more traditional or orthodox religious writings will have to look elsewhere. But others who long for a feminine vision--whether to heal a spiritual crisis or simply find a quote to stick by a computer monitor--will find this anthology deeply satisfying. The first half is devoted to historical voices, such as Julian of Norwich, England; the Ashanti women of Ghana; and Lady Kasa of Japan. In the second half, "Voices of Our Times," readers will find the likes of Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf, Pema Ch�dr�n, Sharon Olds, and Amy Tan. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>Mary Ford-Grabowsky is an award-winning writer, editor, and teacher with a specialty in the world's mystical traditions. Her publications include inspirational books, such as <em>Prayers for All People</em> and <em>Sacred Poems and Prayers of Love,</em> and many essays and scholarly articles. After receiving a master of divinity degree and a doctorate in theology and spirituality from Princeton Theological Seminary, she taught in the religious studies department of Regis College, later returning to Princeton to become editor of Fellowhsip in Prayer. In 1995 she moved to California at the invitation of the Episcopal theologian Matthew Fox to become vice president and academic dean of the Universtiy of Creation Spirituality in Oakland, where she today serves as a member of the adjunct faculty and board. Among honors she has received are an award from the ecumenical branch of the World Council of Churches for distinguished service in interfaith work.

The part in his hair was exact, and his dark suit was sober but comforting. I am a man you can bring your problems to, that suit said to the paying customer. To the hired help it spoke more curtly: This had better be good, you. There was a red carnation in the lapel, perhaps so that no one on the street would<br>mistake Stuart Ullman for the local undertaker. <br><br>As he listened to Ullman speak, Jack admitted to himself that he probably could not have liked any man on that side of the desk&#x2014;under the circumstances. <br><br>Ullman had asked a question he hadn&#x2019;t caught. That was bad; Ullman was the type of man who would file such lapses away in a mental Rolodex for later consideration. <br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I asked if your wife fully understood what you would be taking on here. And there&#x2019;s your son, of course.&#x201d; He glanced down at the application in front of him. &#x201c;Daniel. Your wife isn&#x2019;t a bit intimidated by the idea?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wendy is an extraordinary woman.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;And your son is also extraordinary?&#x201d; <br><br>Jack smiled, a big wide PR smile. &#x201c;We like to think so, I suppose. He&#x2019;s quite self-reliant for a five-year-old.&#x201d; <br><br>No returning smile from Ullman. He slipped Jack&#x2019;s application back into a file. The file went into a drawer. The desk top was now completely bare except for a blotter, a telephone, a Tensor lamp, and an in/out basket. Both sides of the in/out were empty, too.<br><br>Ullman stood up and went to the file cabinet in the corner. &#x201c;Step around the desk, if you will, Mr. Torrance. We&#x2019;ll look at the hotel floor plans.&#x201d;<br><br>He brought back five large sheets and set them down on the glossy walnut plane of the desk. Jack stood by his shoulder, very much aware of the scent of Ullman&#x2019;s cologne. All my men wear English Leather or they wear nothing at all came into his mind for no reason at all, and he had to clamp his tongue between his teeth to keep in a bray of laughter. Beyond the wall, faintly, came the sounds of the Overlook Hotel&#x2019;s kitchen, gearing down from lunch.<br><br>&#x201c;Top floor,&#x201d; Ullman said briskly. &#x201c;The attic. Absolutely nothing up there now but bric-a-brac. The Overlook has changed hands several times since World War II and it seems that each successive manager has put everything they don&#x2019;t want up in the attic. I want rattraps and poison bait sowed around in it. Some of the third-floor chambermaids say they have heard rustling noises. I don&#x2019;t believe it, not for a moment, but there mustn&#x2019;t even be that one-in-a-hundred chance that a single rat inhabits the Overlook Hotel.&#x201d;<br><br>Jack, who suspected that every hotel in the world had a rat or two, held his tongue.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course you wouldn&#x2019;t allow your son up in the attic under any circumstances.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Jack said, and flashed the big PR smile again. Humiliating situation. Did this officious little prick actually think he would allow his son to goof around in a rattrap attic full of junk furniture and God knew what else?<br><br>Ullman whisked away the attic floor plan and put it on the bottom of the pile.<br><br>&#x201c;The Overlook has one hundred and ten guest quarters,&#x201d; he said in a scholarly voice. &#x201c;Thirty of them, all suites, are here on the third floor. Ten in the west wing (including the Presidential Suite), ten in the center, ten more in the east wing. All of them command magnificent views.&#x201d;<br><br>Could you at least spare the salestalk?<br><br>But he kept quiet. He needed the job.<br><br>Ullman put the third floor on the bottom of the pile and they studied the second floor.<br>&#x201c;Forty rooms,&#x201d; Ullman said, &#x201c;thirty doubles and ten singles. And on the first floor, twenty of each. Plus three linen closets on each floor, and a storeroom which is at the extreme east end of the hotel on the second floor and the extreme west end on the first. Questions?&#x201d;<br><br>Jack shook his head. Ullman whisked the second and first floors away.<br><br>&#x201c;Now. Lobby level. Here in the center is the registration desk. Behind it are the offices. The lobby runs for eighty feet in either direction from the desk. Over here in the west wing is the Overlook Dining Room and the Colorado Lounge. The banquet and ballroom facility is in the east wing. Questions?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Only about the basement,&#x201d; Jack said. &#x201c;For the winter caretaker, that&#x2019;s the most important level of all. Where the action is, so to speak.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Watson will show you all that. The basement floor plan is on the boiler room wall.&#x201d; He frowned impressively, perhaps to show that as manager, he did not concern himself with such mundane aspects of the Overlook&#x2019;s operation as the boiler and the plumbing. &#x201c;Might not be a bad idea to put some traps down there too. Just a minute...&#x201d;<br><br>He scrawled a note on a pad he took from his inner coat pocket (each sheet bore the legend From the Desk of Stuart Ullman in bold black script), tore it off, and dropped it into the out basket. It sat there looking lonesome. The pad disappeared back into Ullman&#x2019;s jacket pocket like the conclusion of a magician&#x2019;s trick. Now you see it, Jacky-boy, now you don&#x2019;t. This guy is a real heavyweight.<br><br>They had resumed their original positions, Ullman behind the desk and Jack in front of it, interviewer and interviewee, supplicant and reluctant patron. Ullman folded his neat little hands on the desk blotter and looked directly at Jack, a small, balding man in a banker&#x2019;s suit and a quiet gray tie. The flower in his lapel was balanced off by a small lapel pin on the other side. It read simply STAFF&nbsp; in small gold letters.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be perfectly frank with you, Mr. Torrance. Albert Shockley is a powerful man with a large interest in the Overlook, which showed a profit this season for the first time in its history. Mr. Shockley also sits on the Board of Directors, but he is not a hotel man and he would be the first to admit this. But he has made his wishes in this caretaking matter quite obvious. He wants you hired. I will do so. But if I had been given a free hand in this matter, I would not have taken you on.&#x201d;<br><br>Jack&#x2019;s hands were clenched tightly in his lap, working against each other, sweating. Officious little prick, officious little prick, officious&#x2014;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe you care much for me, Mr. Torrance. I don&#x2019;t care. Certainly your feelings toward me play no part in my own belief that you are not right for the job. During the season that runs from May fifteenth to September thirtieth, the Overlook employs one hun- dred and ten people full-time; one for every room in the hotel, you might say. I don&#x2019;t think many of them like me and I suspect that some of them think I&#x2019;m a bit of a bastard. They would be correct in their judgment of my character. I have to be a bit of a bastard to run this hotel in the manner it deserves.&#x201d;<br><br>He looked at Jack for comment, and Jack flashed the PR smile again, large and insultingly toothy.<br><br>Ullman said: &#x201c;The Overlook was built in the years 1907 to 1909. The closest town is Sidewinder, forty miles east of here over roads that are closed from sometime in late October or November until sometime in April. A man named Robert Townley Watson built it, the grandfather of our present maintenance man. Vanderbilts have stayed here, and Rockefellers, and Astors, and Du Ponts. Four Presidents have stayed in the Presidential Suite. Wilson, Harding, Roosevelt, and Nixon.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t be too proud of Harding and Nixon,&#x201d; Jack murmured.<br><br>Ullman frowned but went on regardless. &#x201c;It proved too much for Mr. Watson, and he sold the hotel in 1915. It was sold again in 1922, in 1929, in 1936. It stood vacant until the end of World War II, when it was purchased and completely renovated by Horace Derwent, millionaire inventor, pilot, film producer, and entrepreneur.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know the name,&#x201d; Jack said.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. Everything he touched seemed to turn to gold... except the Overlook. He funneled over a million dollars into it before the first postwar guest ever stepped through its doors, turning a decrepit relic into a show- place. It was Derwent who added the roque court I saw you admiring when you arrived.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Roque? &#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A British forebear of our croquet, Mr. Torrance. Croquet is bastardized roque. According to legend, Derwent learned the game from his social secretary and fell completely in love with it. Ours may be the finest roque court in America.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t doubt it,&#x201d; Jack said gravely. A roque court, a topiary full of hedge animals out front, what next? A life-sized Uncle Wiggily game behind the equipment shed? He was getting very tired of Mr. Stuart Ullman, but he could see that Ullman wasn&#x2019;t done. Ullman was going to have his say, every last word of it. <br><br>&#x201c;When he had lost three million, Derwent sold it to a group of California investors. Their experience with the Overlook was equally bad. Just not hotel people.<br><br>&#x201c;In 1970, Mr. Shockley and a group of his associates bought the hotel and turned its management over to me. We have also run in the red for several years, but I&#x2019;m happy to say that the trust of the present owners in me has never wavered. Last year we broke even. And this year the Overlook&#x2019;s accounts were written in black ink for the first time in almost seven decades.&#x201d;<br><br>Jack supposed that this fussy little man&#x2019;s pride was justified, and then his original dislike washed over him again in a wave.<br><br>He said: &#x201c;I see no connection between the Overlook&#x2019;s admittedly colorful history and your feeling that I&#x2019;m wrong for the post, Mr. Ullman.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;One reason that the Overlook has lost so much money lies in the depreciation that occurs each winter. It shortens the profit margin a great deal more than you might believe, Mr. Torrance. The winters are fantastically cruel. In order to cope with the problem, I&#x2019;ve installed a full-time winter caretaker to run the boiler and to heat different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis. To repair breakage as it occurs and to do repairs, so the elements can&#x2019;t get a foothold. To be constantly alert to any and every contingency. During our first winter I hired a family instead of a single man. There was a tragedy. A horrible tragedy.&#x201d;<br><br>Ullman looked at Jack coolly and appraisingly.<br><br>&#x201c;I made a mistake. I admit it freely. The man was a drunk.&#x201d;<br><br>Jack felt a slow, hot grin&#x2014;the total antithesis of the toothy PR grin&#x2014;stretch across his mouth. &#x201c;Is that it? I&#x2019;m surprised Al didn&#x2019;t tell you. I&#x2019;ve retired.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, Mr. Shockley told me you no longer drink. He also told me about your last job... your last position of trust, shall we say? You were teaching English in a Vermont prep school. You lost your temper, I don&#x2019;t believe I need to be any more specific than that. But I do happen to believe that Grady&#x2019;s case has a bearing, and that is why I have brought the matter of your... uh, previous history into the conversation. During the winter of 1970&#x2013;71, after we had refurbished the Overlook but before our first season, I hired this... this unfortunate named Delbert Grady. He moved into the quarters you and your wife and son will be sharing. He had a wife and two daughters. I had reservations, the main ones being the harshness of the winter season and the fact that the Gradys would be cut off from the outside world for five to six months.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But that&#x2019;s not really true, is it? There are telephones here, and probably a citizen&#x2019;s band radio as well. And the Rocky Mountain National Park is within helicopter range and surely a piece of ground that big must have a chopper or two.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t know about that,&#x201d; Ullman said. &#x201c;The hotel does have a two-way radio that Mr. Watson will show you, along with a list of the correct frequencies to broadcast on if you need help. The telephone lines between here and Sidewinder are still aboveground, and they go down almost every winter at some point or other and are apt to stay down for three weeks to a month and a half. There is a snowmobile in the equipment shed also.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then the place really isn&#x2019;t cut off.&#x201d;<br><br>Mr. Ullman looked pained. &#x201c;Suppose your son or your wife tripped on the stairs and fractured his or her skull, Mr. Torrance. Would you think the place was cut off then?&#x201d;<br><br>Jack saw the point. A snowmobile running at top speed could get you down to Sidewinder in an hour and a half... maybe. A helicopter from the Parks Rescue Service could get up here in three hours... under optimum conditions. In a blizzard it would never even be able to lift off and you couldn&#x2019;t hope to run a snowmobile at top speed, even if you dared take a seriously injured person out into temperatures that might be twenty-five below&#x2014;or forty-five below, if you added in the wind chill factor.<br><br>&#x201c;In the case of Grady,&#x201d; Ullman said, &#x201c;I reasoned much as Mr. Shockley seems to have done in your case. Solitude can be damaging in itself. Better for the man to have his family with him. If there was trouble, I thought, the odds were very high that it would be something less urgent than a fractured skull or an accident with one of the power tools or some sort of convulsion. A serious case of the flu, pneumonia, a broken arm, even appendicitis. Any of those things would have left enough time.<br><br>&#x201c;I suspect that what happened came as a result of too much cheap whiskey, of which Grady had laid in a generous supply, unbeknownst to me, and a curious condition which the old-timers call cabin fever. Do you know the term?&#x201d; Ullman offered a patronizing little smile, ready to explain as soon as Jack admitted his ignorance, and Jack was happy to respond quickly and crisply.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a slang term for the claustrophobic reaction that can occur when people are shut in together over long periods of time. The feeling of claustrophobia is externalized as dislike for the people you happen to be shut in with. In extreme cases it can result in hallucinations and violence&#x2014;murder has been done over such minor things as a burned meal or an argument about whose turn it is to do the dishes.&#x201d;<br><br>Ullman looked rather nonplussed, which did Jack a world of good. He decided to press a little further, but silently promised Wendy he would stay cool.<br><br>&#x201c;I suspect you did make a mistake at that. Did he hurt them?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He killed them, Mr. Torrance, and then committed suicide. He murdered the little girls with a hatchet, his wife with a shotgun, and himself the same way. His leg was broken. Undoubtedly so drunk he fell downstairs.&#x201d;</p><h2>Mengele: The Complete Story</h2><p>Based on their examination of more than five thousand pages of Dr. Josef Mengele&#39;s personal writings and other documents, the authors reconstruct the events of his thirty-year exile in South America</p><p>Gerald L.

In Nicaragua, where he discovers an untapped tarpon paradise, he also finds beer that comes<br>"with a napkin over the mouth of the bottle and a straw poked through the napkin, the local version of bug armor."

He's my kind of fisherman,<br>deer hunter, and wing shot. Which is to say the, um, very amateur kind.

Six teenagers go camping in a nearby forest. They&#x2019;re the in-crowd of their school; the kids for whom the future looks bright. But one of them, Aurora, the younger sister of queen bee Topaz, doesn&#x2019;t make it out of the forest. Thirty years after her disappearance, a body is found, and the long-cold case is suddenly active again.

The self-sabotaging, bungling, and impulsive part of the personality. This misguided, hidden nemesis&#x2014;the devil on your shoulder&#x2014;blows your diet, overspends, and ruins your love life. A menacing older sibling to your emotionally needy Inner Child, your Outer Child acts out and fulfills your legitimate childlike needs and wants in the wrong place, at the wrong time, and in counterproductive ways: It goes for immediate gratification and the quick fix in spite of your best-laid plans. Food, attention, emotional release&#x2014;your Outer Child usually gets what it wants, and your Adult self can feel powerless to stop it.<br> <br>Now, in a revolutionary rethinking of the link between emotion and behavior, veteran psychotherapist and theoretician Susan Anderson offers a three-step, paradigm-shifting program to tame your Outer Child&#x2019;s destructive behavior. This dynamic, transformational set of strategies&#x2014;action steps that act like physical therapy for the brain&#x2014;calms your Inner Child, strengthens your Adult Self and releases you from the self-blame and shame that are the root of Outer Child issues, and paves new neural pathways that can lead to more productive behavior. Discover<br><br>� the common Outer Child personality types, including the Drama Queen; the Master of Disguise; My Way or No Way; and Love the Getting, not the Having<br> � proven techniques to resolve underlying sources of self-sabotage<br> � insights that will allow you to stop blaming your supposed &#x201c;lack of willpower&#x201d; for your problems<br> � key strategies for healing the painful issues of your past<br> � mental exercises that effectively deal with Outer Child challenges around food, procrastination, love, debt, depression, and more<br> &nbsp;<br> As your head, heart, and behavior come together and learn to help, not hurt, one another, your strong Adult Self, contented Inner child, and tamed Outer child will become a reality. The result is happiness and fulfillment, self-mastery, and self-love.</p><p><b>Susan Anderson</b>, LCSW, has devoted more than thirty years of clinical experience and research to working with the victims of trauma, abandonment, grief, and loss. The creator of the Outer Child concept and the founder of the abandonment recovery movement, she is the author of <i>The Journey from Abandonment to Healing, Black Swan: The Twelve Lessons of Abandonment Recovery, </i>and <i>The Journey from Heartbreak to Connection</i>. In addition to her lectures and workshops, she continues private practice in Manhattan and on Long Island.ONE<br><br>Welcome to Your Outer Child<br><br>What makes you break your diet, or run up your credit card, or be attracted to all the wrong people? You know these aren&#x2019;t healthy things to do, you know you&#x2019;re sabotaging your own best interest, but sometimes you just can&#x2019;t help it. Sometimes you want what you want and there&#x2019;s no reasoning with the devil on your shoulder!<br><br>Each of us has self-sabotaging tendencies, the origins of which elude us. Be confused no longer! I&#x2019;m here to tell you that these behaviors are attributable to a part of your personality that perhaps you didn&#x2019;t even know you had: your Outer Child.<br><br>You may already be familiar with the concept of an Inner Child, a psychological construct developed by John Bradshaw, Charles Whitfield, and others. Your Inner Child is your emotional core, the innocent, vulnerable, often needy part of your personality. Many of its feelings emerged at a tender young age and still reside in your psyche; others arise anew from fresh experience. Whatever the origins of its feelings, your Inner Child needs tending to, it needs to be heard, it should be honored.<br><br>No less important, your Outer Child is a psychological concept that I have identified to describe the part of your personality that acts out your Inner Child&#x2019;s feelings in self-defeating ways, without giving you, the Adult in charge, a chance to intervene. Simply put, your Outer Child is responsible for your misbehavior. Think of your Outer Child as the impulsive and willful adolescent in you: the person who has trouble regulating behavior and resisting primal urges. Your Outer Child says yes to a third glass of wine when you, the Adult, had already decided on a two-drink limit. Your Outer Child decides to watch the game when you&#x2019;d resolved to clean out the garage. Your Outer Child wants what it wants and pulls out all the stops to get its own way.<br><br>As with an Inner Child, we all have an Outer Child; it is not a flaw. It is, however, the obstinate, selfish, self-centered part of us we all share&#x2014;a part that until now we have failed to recognize as universal. Outer Child is universal because we all have primal feelings we are barely aware of but that drive our most deeply entrenched defense mechanisms and knee-jerk reactions&#x2014;if we let them.<br><br>Your Outer Child manifests outwardly what your Inner Child feels inside. For instance, if your Inner Child&#x2019;s core fear is abandonment, it is your Outer Child that manifests this fear with all sorts of inappropriate behaviors. When you feel insecure in a romantic relationship, Outer acts out your vulnerable feelings in ways that can only be interpreted as desperate. You might freak out, freeze up, or blow up when your date keeps you waiting more than a few minutes for a call back. In fact, Outer Child usually has a hair trigger when it comes to abandonment fear&#x2014;the nerve that jangles so easily when any of us feel slighted, dismissed, or rejected. Hence waiting those few minutes for the phone to ring triggers an overriding fear that you will wind up all alone, bereft of love forever.<br><br>Lest you think that I&#x2019;m giving a name to this part of your personality in order to let us all off the hook for bad behavior, think again! Being able to identify and recognize your Outer Child is an important step toward taming it. I have found with my work in private practice with clients and with countless workshop attendees that being able to separate the personality in this way is the first important step toward controlling your actions and your own emotional destiny.<br><br>I initially coined the term Outer Child for my book Journey from Abandonment to Healing (2000). I didn&#x2019;t introduce the concept and a list of Outer Child traits until nearly the end of the book, but Outer Child somehow managed to take center stage. Almost immediately after publication I began hearing from readers wanting more information about how to tame their wayward Outer Children. I have spent the past decade applying this tool to a broader range of issues and clinically testing exercises I&#x2019;ve adapted to overcome Outer Child&#x2019;s most entrenched behaviors, a program you&#x2019;ll read about in the following pages and chapters.<br><br>YOU DON&#x2019;T HAVE TO BE THAT PERSON<br><br>Think of the things you yearn for&#x2014;to have a happier love life, to break free of debt, to achieve greater recognition in your field&#x2014;and consider all the impulsive little things you do that actually hinder your progress toward those goals. Your Outer Child represents that hindrance; it&#x2019;s all the counterproductive habits and tendencies that keep you forever wanting to achieve, but always falling short.<br><br>Let&#x2019;s say your Inner Child feels a little anxious in a social situation and urgently wants you to make a good impression. Your Outer Child acts out your nervousness, insisting on making its own impression. It might share information that&#x2019;s way too personal for cocktail party banter, or express an opinion with the kind of vehemence best reserved for competitive debate. So much for that good impression.<br><br>One of Outer&#x2019;s favorite ploys is procrastination. It creates as much sabotage by what it doesn&#x2019;t do as by what it does, gumming up the works with indecision and passivity. For instance, it ignores you when you tell it what to do, like &#x201c;Go to the gym.&#x201d; Instead Outer just goes right on eating potato chips and lounging in front of the TV. Outer Child is the guy who talks constantly about how he&#x2019;s going move to a cattle ranch out west, but never gets around to it. You don&#x2019;t have to be that person. You can do something to tip the balance in favor of your Adult Self when those internal power struggles arise.<br><br>The concept of the Outer Child is a revolutionary self-awareness tool that lets you look at your own behavior from a powerful new perspective. It reveals the third dimension of your personality: the self-rebellious dimension. In exploring this new dimension, you gain access to a part of yourself that was operating undercover, until now.<br><br>Those of you familiar with the terms Id, Ego, and Superego may wonder how the concept of an Outer Child fits in. They&#x2019;re closely related, though Outer Child is a newly identified component of the psyche, one that expands Freud&#x2019;s theory of the Id by taking it into the behavioral realm. We&#x2019;ll explore this relationship in more detail in the next chapter.<br><br>For now, I want to reassure you that you can redress and redirect your Outer Child&#x2019;s subterfuge; it doesn&#x2019;t have to hold you back any longer. Whether Outer Child has been preventing you from sticking to a diet, curbing your spending, overcoming performance anxiety, ending procrastination, improving a relationship, becoming a better parent, or reaching your potential, you can finally create the change you&#x2019;ve always dreamed of.<br><br>In the interest of full disclosure, it&#x2019;s important to know that your Outer Child isn&#x2019;t going to give up its power over you without a fight. Which is why the program I created offers powerful tools for overcoming its resistance. Outer Child doggedly fights change&#x2014;especially change directed at its favorite bad habits. It balks at doing the right thing and hankers after precisely those things that are bad for your health, reputation, marriage, career, figure, or bank account.<br><br>That&#x2019;s because Outer is a glutton for immediate gratification and adept at foiling your best laid self-improvement plans by cleverly substituting self-indulgence for self-nurturance. The difference between the two is vast, but Outer, a master of rationalization, does its best to confuse them. Self-nurturing is taking action to truly benefit your life. Outer prefers self-indulging, in other words, momentary feel-good things like buying an extravagance on credit, or taking another nap&#x2014;things that are easy to rationalize in the short run, but sabotage your goals and dreams in the long run. You will learn exercises throughout this book to help you delay gratification, remain goal-directed, and guide your behavior in the direction of your highest potential.<br><br>OUTER CHILD AS LOVE ADDICT<br><br>So who, exactly, can benefit from this program? For starters, many of the people who read my first book on abandonment. I mentioned above that a lot of your self-sabotaging behaviors hearken back to unresolved abandonment issues. Depending on your earlier losses, heartbreaks, and disappointments, Outer Child can wreak havoc in romantic situations by acting too needy. When you become unsure of your partner&#x2019;s love, you grow these enormous emotional suction cups that are irresistibly drawn to your lover. You frantically try to hide them lest they scare her away, but to no avail; new emotional suction cups keep surfacing, making it increasingly difficult to appear self-contained. The Outer Child program shows you how to redirect that neediness at yourself&#x2014;so that you, and not an unwitting partner, become ultimately responsible for fulfilling your deepest emotional needs.<br><br>Outer Child has lots of other relationship issues. One of its patterns is so prevalent that in one of my books I coined a special term for it: abandoholism&#x2014;addiction to the emotional drama and love chemicals of abandonment. Abandoholics are exclusively attracted to people who are unavailable. Their Outer Children only feel passion when in &#x201c;pursuit mode&#x201d;&#x2014;when they are trying to win over someone&#x2019;s love. This puts many an otherwise secure marriage (in which partners sometimes take each other for granted) in the doldrums and has many a single person chasing after hard-if-not-impossible-to-get lovers. There are those who are well aware of the fact that they&#x2019;re love addicts and would readily admit they &#x201c;get a high on abandohol&#x201d; and complain that &#x201c;otherwise life feels too humdrum.&#x201d;<br><br>Abandoholic Outer Children are addicted to the biochemistry of abandonment, which is why they suddenly feel no chemistry when a previously unavailable romantic interest actually does become available. Learning to tame your Outer Child helps you uncross your brain wires so that you can feel love and passion without having to chase an emotional challenge.<br><br>WHEN OUTER CHILD TAKES CONTROL<br><br>Outer Child specializes in power and control. Its primary adversary is your Adult Self. When you try to achieve a goal, Outer Child can act like an oppositionally defiant 10-year-old. Outer is bent on wearing you down, on getting you to fall back into one of your old habits, addictions, or compulsions. That&#x2019;s why awareness alone isn&#x2019;t enough to stop it. You&#x2019;ll need my program&#x2019;s specialized tools to learn how to take the reins securely into your own hands.<br><br>Outer Child has been known to grab control of the celebrity spotlight. We&#x2019;ve all witnessed some of our most honored officials, athletes, and movie stars whose Outer Children got caught in the act of philandering, using steroids or other drugs, perpetrating financial scandals, or shouting &#x201c;politically incorrect&#x201d; epithets in public&#x2014;all examples of their Outer Children breaking through their public personas and gaining control.<br><br>Speaking of control . . .<br><br>Beware: Outer can catch you off guard and take control when you least expect it, especially when you are angry. Outer overreacts to anger. Sometimes it overreacts by underreacting. This is because many people are too insecure to risk expressing direct anger toward someone (like their boss or lover); they fear losing that person&#x2019;s acceptance. Outer can act out your fear and lack of assertiveness by getting you to take your anger out on yourself. One of my workshop attendees described just such an episode:<br><br>The other day when I failed to speak up for myself for the millionth time, I started slamming things around the kitchen. I accidentally broke a dish I really liked. That was my good old Outer Child acting-out in its usual self-destructive way.<br><br>In other cases, Outer takes your anger out on innocent bystanders and makes you look like a monster. As one workshop attendee put it, &#x201c;When my Outer Child is cranky, it tries to bite someone&#x2019;s head off.&#x201d;<br><br>Outer&#x2019;s control issues really kick up in relationships: When Outer Child gets into power struggles with other people&#x2019;s Outer Children, watch out. Outer Children tend to battle one another for control and wrangle over &#x201c;who&#x2019;s right.&#x201d; They also take one another as emotional hostages, demanding reparations for hurts and betrayals inflicted by old relationships, dating all the way back to childhood. (If only you could send your respective Outer Children out to play&#x2014;or to Outer Childcare!&#x2014;so that the Adults could work things out rationally and fairly.) The Outer Child program I will offer in this book shows you how to nip these Outer Child shenanigans in the bud and untangle the interference. My program provides a powerful new model for couples counseling as well.<br><br>Your Outer Child doesn&#x2019;t just try to bully your partner or other people; it bullies you: When your Adult Self is too weak and your Outer Child is too strong (as it is for many of us), Outer can become so powerful that it completely controls the person.<br><br>Some people, like this former client, are almost all Outer Child:<br><br>I ate what I wanted, even though I got fat and lost my looks. I drank want I wanted, even after I got arrested a few times for drunk driving. I spent what I wanted, even though I eventually foreclosed on my mortgage.<br><br>Think of your Outer Child as a horse&#x2014;an untamed horse&#x2014;and your Adult Self as a trainer trying to mount it. Sometimes the horse is more determined, more powerful than the trainer and you&#x2019;re thrown from the horse. Then Outer Child goes galloping off in his own direction. The Outer Child program in this book educates you about the creature you&#x2019;re trying to control, offers tools for the job and lots and lots of opportunities to practice using these tools so that eventually you&#x2019;ll be the one in control.<br><br>OUTER CHILD UNDERCOVER<br><br>Outer&#x2019;s maneuvers can be subtle. It wears many disguises. It slyly masquerades as free will, while leaving you, the Adult, in shackles. It poses as your ally, but is really distracting you from attending to your true needs.<br><br>Since Outer Child is an outward manifestation of your emotional self, some of its characteristics are on prominent public display, out in the open for others to see. We don&#x2019;t mind owning up to some of these behaviors, but there are others we don&#x2019;t like to acknowledge. It&#x2019;s far easier to identify those in other people. Take self-centeredness for example: Outer loves to project this less-than-stellar trait onto others, usually behind their backs. (&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t stand the way she grabs center stage; it&#x2019;s always all about her. I never get a chance to say anything.&#x201d;) Gaining Outer Child awareness allows us to own up to our own self-centeredness and transform it into a positive force.<br><br>Think of it this way: Outer is you on autopilot. Its mission&#x2014;to hijack your Adult Self&#x2019;s best interests&#x2014;keeps you forever stuck in old patterns. Outer is always waiting in the wings to spring one of its knee-jerk, defensive strategies, especially when you&#x2019;re trying to change.</p><h2>The Emigrants</h2><p>Journeying through England, Austria, and America to salvage memories of the Holocaust, four narratives capture the lives of four people in exile--a painter, an elderly White Russian, Sebald&#39;s schoolteacher, and his own eccentric Great Uncle Ambrose--in a family portrait of a family destroyed.</p><p>In this remarkable work of fiction, W.G. Sebald explores the power of memory as he traces the lives of four people uprooted by war and prejudice. Each of the stories reflect the tragic impact of World War II on the survivors, who struggle with a loss of home, a loss of language, and a loss of self. Through memories, each person attempts to make sense of their histories and bridge the chasm the war ripped in their lives. Combined with each story are photographs that purport to show the subjects of the stories. The combination of photographs, biography, and autobiography combine to form a meditative, lyrical story that is at once powerful and introspective.W. G. Sebald was born Winfried George Maximillian Sebald in Wertach im Allg�u, in the Bavarian Alps in 1944. From 1975 he taught at the University of East Anglia, became Professor of German in 1986, and was the first director of the British Centre for Translation. He won the Berlin Literature, Literatur Nord, and M�rike Prizes, as well as the Johannes Bobrowski medal, plus the Los Angeles Times Book Award for Fiction (The Rings of Saturn). New Directions was the first to publish his book here: The Rings of Saturn, The Emigrants, and Vertigo. He died in an automobile accident in Norfolk, England, near his home in Norwich in East Anglia, England, on December 14, 2001.</p><h2>Before I Get Old: The Story of the Who</h2><p>Traces the history of the British rock band, the Who, and examines the development of the group&#39;s musical style</p><p>Author <b>Dave Marsh</b> founded <i>Creem</i> magazine at the age of nineteen.

Impossible, unless-- The Afghan is Izmat Khan, a five-year prisoner of Guant�anamo Bay and a former senior commander of the Taliban. The Afghan is also Colonel Mike Martin, a twenty-five-year veteran of war zones around the world--a dark, lean man born and raised in Iraq.

You know it will be grotesque, that there will be bloodied bodies and hideous dismemberments, yet you can't help yourself. Frederick Forsyth has the ability to mesmerize with an insider's knowledge, and Robert Powell's reading is no less insistent. British and American intelligence learn that Al-Qaeda is planning something big. Will it be nuclear? Biological? No one is sure. Someone has to infiltrate, a nearly impossible task. Nearly. British intelligence officer Mike Martin (THE FIST OF GOD) is the man for the job.

His daughter is found and brought up by a shepherd on the Bohemian coast, but through a series of extraordinary events, father and daughter, and eventually mother too, are reunited. <br><br> In <i>The Gap of Time</i>, Jeanette Winterson&#x2019;s cover version of <i>The Winter&#x2019;s Tale</i>, we move from London, a city reeling after the 2008 financial crisis, to a storm-ravaged American city called New Bohemia. Her story is one of childhood friendship, money, status, technology and the elliptical nature of time. Written with energy and wit, this is a story of the consuming power of jealousy on the one hand, and redemption and the enduring love of a lost child on the other.</p><p>Jeanette Winterson OBE has written ten novels, children&#x2019;s books, non-fiction works, and screenplays, and writes regularly for the <i>Guardian</i>. She was adopted by Pentecostal parents and raised in Manchester to be a missionary, which she wrote about in her first novel, <i>Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit,</i> and twenty-seven years later in her bestselling memoir, <i>Why Be Happy When You Could Be Normal?</i> <i>The Winter&#x2019;s Tale</i> tells the story of Perdita, the abandoned child. &#x201c;All of us have talismanic texts that we have carried around and that carry us around. I have worked with <i>The Winter&#x2019;s Tale</i> in many disguises for many years,&#x201d; Jeanette says of the play. The result is <i>The Gap of Time</i>, her cover version.<b>An NPR Best Book of the Year Selection</b><br><br>"<i>The Gap of Time</i> takes the play&#x2019;s themes of love, jealousy and estrangement and spins them into a taut contemporary tale."--<i><b>New York Times</b></i><br><br>&#x201c;Hogarth leads off the series with one of the most gifted writers working today, Jeanette Winterson, taking on the formidable &#x2018;Winter&#x2019;s Tale,&#x2019; and the result is a shining delight of a novel...Winterson&#x2019;s gift for capturing unspoken emotion with powerful but never overwritten lyricism creates a cast of characters whose points of view are fascinating and sometimes harrowing to inhabit, fully employing the novel form&#x2019;s unique ability to illuminate the interiors of the actors on the page...The opening acts of the novel are propelled by an intricately suspenseful series of scenes that capture the raw violence stemming from greed, envy and paranoia. A subtle critique of hyper masculinity, and the attendant violence fueled by money (specifically the loss thereof), ripples meaningfully beneath the novel&#x2019;s surface. Winterson&#x2019;s great gift is capturing the emotional heft of her stories with sentences that hum along, beautiful, unexpected and swift...Winterson wrestles wonderfully with a perplexing text and emerges with a complicated, satisfying and contemporary tale that stands wholly on its own, despite the Bard&#x2019;s significant shadow. But then again, show me a novelist who isn&#x2019;t under that shadow. For that reason, and because Winterson makes the cover business book easy, I imagine many novelists are salivating for chance to write the next book in this promising new series.&#x201d;--<i><b>New York Times Book Review<br><br></b></i>"Winterson doesn&#x2019;t just update the story: she fills in its psychological nuances... It&#x2019;s fun to see Winterson solve the play&#x2019;s problems, but the book&#x2019;s real strength is the way her language shifts between earthy and poetic and her willingness to use whatever she needs to tell the story (angels, video games, carjackings). She makes us read on, our hearts in our mouths, to see how a twice-told story will turn out this time."--<b><i>Publishers Weekly</i>&nbsp;(starred review)</b><br><br>"[<i>The Gap of Time</i>]&nbsp;will keep you enthralled from start to finish."--<b><i>Paste Magazine</i></b><br><br>"The intricacy with which Winterson has plotted her novel against each Shakespearean detail will delight readers familiar with the original ... it&#x2019;s part of a vision of a world in which past, present, and future are lived simultaneously, original and adaptation existing in the same moment."--<b><i>The Times </i>(London)<br></b><br>"A book of considerable beauty... Winterson&#x2019;s fiction is a fine invitation into this deeply Shakespearean vision of imagination as the best kind of truth-telling."--<b><i>New Statesman</i><br></b><br>"Winterson&#x2019;s stage, like that of Shakespeare, is filled with wonders."--<i><b>Times Literary Supplement</b></i><br><br>"Winterson is faithful to both the narrative and the spirit of the play, while transposing it to an utterly different and modern setting... There is lightness here, in the frisky prose and the author&#x2019;s delight in invention, but you are never free of the awareness of dark shadows where danger and corruption lie in wait."--<i><b>Scotsman</b></i><br><br>"Artful...it soars."--<i><b>Financial Times</b></i><br><br>"A deeply felt, emotionally intelligent and serious novel, which resists easy answers and yet expresses the hope that human beings can muddle through, and that bad pasts can have good outcomes... Pulsates with such authenticity and imaginative generosity that I defy you not to engage with it."--<b><i>Evening Standard</i><br></b><br>"<i>The Winter&#x2019;s Tale,&nbsp;</i>one of the late, 'problem' plays, is about loss, remorse and forgiveness, and the nature of time. Winterson has captured all this with respect and affection for Shakespeare&#x2019;s text, and made it new with her own bold and poetic prose and her insights into love and grief. There are passages here so concisely beautiful they give you goosebumps."--<b><i>Radar</i><br></b><br>"With a few deft strokes Winterson creates Shakespeare&#x2019;s characters in contemporary clothing keeping me in suspense throughout. It is a triumph and a good omen for this ambitious new project."--<b><i>Daily Express</i><br></b><br>"Emotionally wrought and profoundly intelligent it will pull you into its troubled, wise world of jealousy, paranoia, grief, revenge and forgiveness in some of the most stunning prose you&#x2019;ll read this year ... Winterson masterfully interweaves layers of narrative and themes so that reading the novel is like listening to a Bach prelude and fugue ... A supremely clever, compelling and emotionally affecting novel that deserves multiple readings to appreciate its many layers."--<i><b>Mail on Sunday<br></b></i><br>"The book is the first of a major new series, in which well-known novelists give Shakespeare a modern twist, and Winterson rises to the challenge with some ingenious touches."--<b><i>Observer</i><br></b><br>"Engrossing, almost soapily addictive novel."--<b><i>The&nbsp;Independent</i><br></b><br>"Astonishing."--<b><i>Elle</i><br></b><br>"There's a lovely, lilting cadence to Winterson's tribute to Shakespeare's penultimate play... Smart and witty... Despite her faithfulness to Shakespeare's storyline, Winterson manages against the odds to keep us gripped...she wins our sympathy and so injects a real sense of jeopardy into a familiar tale. It's no mean feat. Compelling, entertaining and elegant."--<i><b>The&nbsp;Guardian<br></b></i><br>"Moving, pacy... A clever book that explores themes of love, loss and forgiveness as parents screw up their children and do the unthinkable.

This book introduces us to the endless destruction that the green parrots have spread throughout the world, and in so doing raises an urgent question: Is it legitimate to accept war as an inevitable prospect for current and future generations? After appearing in numerous languages since its initial publication in 1999, this English edition is particularly timely. The appendix of <i>Green Parrots</i> contains the complete text of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, approved on December 10, 1948 by the General Assembly of the United Nations, which begins by proclaiming: "All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights."</p><p></p><h2>The Rifle</h2><p>This tough, thought-provoking novel for young adults takes deadly aim at the oft-quoted notion: &#x201c;Guns don&#x2019;t kill people, people kill people.&#x201d; With subtle mastery and precision, Paulsen&#x2019;s novel challenges the idea that firearms don&#x2019;t become instruments of destruction and murder until they are placed in human hands--<i>The Rifle</i> makes it clear that guns <i>do </i>kill people. &#x201c;For readers willing to think about this issue, for those looking for ways to introduce the debate, there is no better vehicle than this short, engagingly written story of one rifle and its fatal impact on one modern boy.&#x201d;--<i>School Library Journal</i><br></p><p>Hardcover edition 1995<br>0-15-292880-4<br>"A truly mesmerizing tale, from beginning to end." <br>--<i>Publishers Weekly,</i> Starred<p> "[An] engagingly written story of one rifle and its fatal impact on one modern boy." <br>--<i>School Library Journal</i></p><p> "Paulsen's message is clear and cutting: a machine made for killing, no matter how lovingly crafted and benignly kept, remains a machine made for killing." <br>--<i>Booklist</i> "Paulsen is at the peak of his powers in a book that is as shattering as the awful events it depicts.

Suddenly, she is surrounded by male admirers, all expecting her to marry them. But before she marries anyone, Rose is determined to establish herself as an independent young woman. Besides, she suspects that some of her friends like her more for her money than for herself.</p><p>Louisa May Alcott (1832 &#x2013;1888) was an American novelist. She is best known for the novel Little Women and its sequels Little Men and Jo's Boys. Little Women was set in the Alcott family home, Orchard House in Concord, Massachusetts, and published in 1868. This novel is loosely based on her childhood experiences with her three sisters. Alcott's literary success arrived with the publication by the Roberts Brothers of the first part of Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy, a semi-autobiographical account of her childhood with her sisters in Concord, Massachusetts. Part two, or Part Second, also known as Good Wives, followed the March sisters into adulthood and their respective marriages. Little Men detailed Jo's life at the Plumfield School that she founded with her husband Professor Bhaer at the conclusion of Part Two of Little Women. Jo's Boys completed the "March Family Saga". In Little Women, Alcott based her heroine "Jo" on herself. But whereas Jo marries at the end of the story, Alcott remained single throughout her life. In her later life, Alcott became an advocate for women's suffrage and was the first woman to register to vote in Concord, Massachusetts, in a school board election. Alcott, along with Elizabeth Stoddard, Rebecca Harding Davis, Anne Moncure Crane, and others, were part of a group of female authors during the Gilded Age who addressed women&#x2019;s issues in a modern and candid manner. Alcott, who continued to write until her death, suffered chronic health problems in her later years. Alcott died of a stroke in Boston, on March 6, 1888, at age 55, two days after visiting her father's deathbed. Her last words were "Is it not meningitis?"Grade 7 Up-Although Louisa May Alcott is best known for classics such as Little Women and Little Men, Rose in Bloom also boasts a lively cast of characters growing up with 19th century social conventions and expectations. A sequel to Eight Cousins, this story finds 20-year-old Rose, the only female cousin, coping with the demands of being an eligible heiress, and her feelings about her widely diverse boy cousins. Blessed with common sense and compassion, Rose and her adopted sister, Phoebe, mature through loss, hard choices, and finally end up with the men that complete them. Barbara Caruso's considerable narration skills are apparent as she conveys exuberance, prim respectability, and sadness. The sound quality is good. Smaller libraries may have to pass on this pleasant addition to their Alcott works in audio format, but public and school libraries that do purchase Rose in Bloom will find it's a refreshing rendition of a lesser known classic.<br><i>Barbara Wysocki, Cora J.

Beth Moore teaches that to be set free from each and every stronghold which claims our lives, we have to replace it with the mind of Christ and fervent daily prayer. <p>Praying God's Word is a topical prayer guide addressing fourteen strongholds and what Scripture reveals about each issue. The Scriptures are presented in prayer form to be incorporated into the daily prayer life as a way of letting God's Word, through prayer, help you overcome the strongholds of bitterness, anger, unforgiveness, and other areas as well. </p></p><p>Popular speaker and bestselling author Beth Moore writes that one of the purposes of <i>Praying God's Word: Breaking Free from Spiritual Strongholds</i> is to help readers "downsize anything that has a hold on you," including pride, addiction, depression, and lack of forgiveness. This is no name-it-and-claim-it book; rather, it's a thoughtful guide for structured prayer, using the Bible as the framework to build upon. She invites readers to demolish their particular strongholds with "two sticks of dynamite: scripture and prayer," and gives both those new to prayer and seasoned prayer veterans the ability to do so. Chapters are arranged topically, and there are blank pages included for personalized prayers on each subject. To emphasize her points, Moore also scatters nuggets of wisdom throughout the text from writers such as Jim Cymbala, Kay Arthur, Charles Spurgeon, and Francis Frangipane. Even when the "stronghold" has been demolished, Moore urges readers to continue to pray God's Word for general maintenance purposes. It's a message that has found a tremendous amount of resonance with readers for its life-changing potential. <i>--Cindy Crosby</i><b>Beth Moore</b> is a writer and teacher of best-selling books and Bible studies whose public speaking engagements carry her all over the United States.

He stops in a chandler's shop filled with fantastic wax creations, but instead of admiring them Thomas scorns the chandler for wasting his time on sculptures that will only melt. The mysterious old chandler sells him a special Christmas candle. Back on the bitterly cold street, the young man is accosted by an old beggar woman. When he lifts his lantern to get a better look, the candlelight reveals that she is his mother. He gives her his cloak and only then sees the truth: She is not his mother after all, but a stranger. The candle tricks him again before he reaches home, cold and penniless, but richer for his newfound realization that we are all part of one family.<br> <br> This intriguing original fable about charity is accompanied by lavish, mood-filled oil paintings by artist Jacob Collins. Together, author and artist have created an exquisite holiday gift book that will be treasured by the entire family.</p><p>Would you be more responsive to a brother's request for money than to a beggar's request for money? This is the question that Richard Paul Evans, author of <i>The Christmas Box</i>, asks his readers to consider in <i>The Christmas Candle</i>, a morality tale whose haunting moodiness evokes the Dickensian ghost of Christmas past. In this story, a rather unpleasant-seeming young man named Thomas is making his way home on a dark, bitterly cold Christmas Eve. In search of a candle for his tin lantern, he pushes aside a beggar to enter the shop of a village candlemaker, who has rows and rows of candles sculpted into angels, sprites, princesses. Thomas, impatient, just wants a plain old candle. The Yoda-like candlemaker sells him one, warning cryptically, "It is only four coppers, but you may find it costly." Indeed. This strange candle somehow makes Thomas see his mother's face in the face of the next beggar he encounters, and a figure lying in the gutter reveals itself to him as his brother. He gives them everything he has. Finally, penniless and cold, he reaches the music and laughter of his childhood home. When his family asks him why he has arrived empty-handed, he suddenly understands why the old man told him the candle would be costly, and his heart fills with joy: "For that Christmas Eve, a lesson was learned and taken to heart: If we will see things as they truly are, we will find that all, from great to small, belong to one family." <i>The Christmas Candle</i>--heavily laden with American Realist Jacob Collins's gloomy still-life paintings and bleak, eerily lit oil portraits of dour-faced beggars--is not exactly a joyous expression of holiday cheer. It is, however, a time-tested tale of charity that will resonate with young and old alike. (Ages 6 and older)Richard Paul Evans&nbsp;is the #1 bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>The Christmas Box</i>.

After introducing their stories, she tackles her topic by subject, bringing each voice to comment on the physical conditions of the tenements, the work available to immigrants, play, education, and food. By incorporating direct quotes and nicely reproduced archival photographs, the author brings the tenement experience to life for the reader. Notes at the end fully document all her sources, while a time line and further reading give readers access to more information. The book is beautifully designed, with plenty of space given to the photographs, so that no page is text heavy. The square, open format definitely gives it the look of a "children's book," although middle school readers at the upper range of the book's audience will get the most out of this excellent source. There is little available on the topic for this age. Although both excellent books, Linda Granfield's 97 Orchard Street, New York (Tundra, 2001/VOYA December 2001) is a less engaging read, and Raymond Bial's Tenement (Houghton Mifflin, 2002) is for a somewhat younger audience.-Nina Lindsay. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;Kirkus STARRED&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;September 15th, 2003&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;Between 1880 and 1919, 23 million people came to America, most through the port of New York and most from eastern and southern Europe. Five young individuals and their experiences represent those masses in this well-conceived volume. Hopkinson covers the journey, Ellis Island, tenements, street life, work, reform movements, and education, always rooted in the actual stories and words of individual immigrants. Archival photographs&#x2013;including many by Lewis Hine and Jacob Riis, excerpts from autobiographies and oral histories, and meticulous documentation, with a section on resources for young readers, make this an excellent model of historical writing. Hopkinson's enthusiasm for research, primary sources, and individual stories that make history come alive is evident throughout this excellent work. Nonfiction at its best and a good companion to Mary Jane Auch's Ashes to Roses (2002), Johanna Hurwitz's Dear Emma (2002), and other recent works on the subject.

The same can be said of Hopkinson's own absorbing look at the lives of immigrant children and young adults in New York at the turn of the twentieth century--a time of unprecedented immigration to America. This well-organized social history covers a lot of ground and draws much of its intensity from firsthand accounts. The opening chapters reflect the progression many immigrant children (and adults) made from dreams of easy wealth and happiness to the bleak reality of tenement life. The accessible narrative, effectively supported by well-placed sepia-toned archival photographs, documents the struggles of young immigrants (including dangerous living and working conditions, poverty, lack of education) to carve out better futures for themselves and their families in spite of the obstacles they faced just to survive. A final chapter, filling in later accomplishments made by five specific young people, ends the book on a note of promise. A timeline, list of further reading, bibliography, chapter notes, and index enhance this fascinating glimpse into the past. Copyright 2004 of The Horn Book, Inc.

The medical world knows him as Fred Epstein, M.D., the neurosurgeon who pioneered life-saving procedures for previously inoperable tumors in children. His patients and their families know him simply as Dr. Fred, the "miracle man" who has extended them both a healing hand and an open heart. </p><p>Throughout his career Epstein's young patients have been his most important teachers and trusted guides. They are children who&#x2015;often by sheer force of will&#x2015;have refused to relinquish life and all its gifts. In this inspiring book, these children teach us the lessons we all need to learn in order to live life to the fullest&#x2015;lessons about seizing the moment and facing our deepest fears, about embracing the joy and wonder of everyday life. Most of all, they teach lessons about uncommon courage&#x2015;the courage to do what's hardest, to believe in what we don't understand, to love without boundaries.</p><p><i>If I Get to Five </i>takes us inside a world unlike any other, from the high-stakes, high-tech operating room where life and death are separated by a heartbeat to the sickrooms and recovery rooms where parents discover the limits and power of their faith. But most compelling of all is the journey inside the hearts, minds, and souls of the wisest children you will ever encounter.</p><p>No one who reads this remarkable book will ever look at children&#x2015;or adversity&#x2015;in the same way.</p></p><p>"This book is a testament to the extraordinary depth, power, and resiliency of children's spirits.

From Dr. Epstein's portrayals of children who have found meaning amid horror to his own superbly interwoven autobiography of a boyhood marred by academic failure, we see the emergence of a truly great man.

The first portion of the book is an investigation of functions, exploring the graphical behavior of, interpretation of, and solutions to problems involving linear, polynomial, rational, exponential, and logarithmic functions. An emphasis is placed on modeling and interpretation, as well as the important characteristics needed in calculus. The second portion of the book introduces trigonometry. Trig is introduced through an integrated circle/triangle approach. Identities are introduced in the first chapter, and revisited throughout. Likewise, solving is introduced in the second chapter and revisted more extensively in the third chapter. As with the first part of the book, an emphasis is placed on motivating the concepts and on modeling and interpretation.</p><p>David Lippman received his master&#x2019;s degree in mathematics from Western Washington University and has been teaching at Pierce College since Fall 2000. Melonie Rasmussen also received her master&#x2019;s degree in mathematics from Western Washington University and has been teaching at Pierce College since Fall 2002. Prior to this Melonie taught for the Puyallup School district for 6 years after receiving her teaching credentials from Pacific Lutheran University. We have both been long time advocates of open learning, open materials, and basically any idea that will reduce the cost of education for students. It started by supporting the college&#x2019;s calculator rental program, and running a book loan scholarship program. Eventually the frustration with the escalating costs of commercial text books and the online homework systems that charged for access led them to take action. First, David developed IMathAS, open source online math homework software that runs WAMAP.org and MyOpenMath.com. Through this platform, we became integral parts of a vibrant sharing and learning community of teachers from around Washington State that support and contribute to WAMAP. Our pioneering efforts, supported by dozens of other dedicated faculty and financial support from the Transition Math Project, have led to a system used by thousands of students every quarter, saving hundreds of thousands of dollars over comparable commercial offerings. David continued further and wrote his first open textbook, Math in Society, a math for liberal arts majors book, after being frustrated by students having to pay $100+ for a textbook for a terminal course. Together, frustrated by both cost and the style of commercial texts, we began writing PreCalculus: An Investigation of Functions in 2010.</p><h2>On Being a Master Therapist: Practicing What You Preach</h2><p><b>Learn from master therapists and bring your skills to the next level</b> <p>Bringing a breath of fresh air to the therapy profession, this compelling and thoughtful resource urges readers to move from competency to full mastery in the mental health field.

His speculations, especially about the nature of time, had a profound influence on many other philosophers, as well as on poets and novelists; they are said to have been the seed for <i>� la recherce de temps perdu</i> by Marcel Proust (whose cousin was Bergson's wife). Though his ideas were sometimes difficult to follow, Bergson was also a fine stylist, who once declared, "there is nothing in philosophy which could not be said in everyday language," and who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1927.<br>In <i>Time and Free Will,</i> written as his doctoral thesis, Bergson tries to dispel the arguments against free will. These arguments, he shows, come from a confusion of different ideas of time. Physicists and mathematicians conceive of time as a measurable construct much like the spatial dimensions. But in human experience, life is perceived as a continuous and unmeasurable flow rather than as a succession of marked-off states of consciousness &#x2014; something that can be measured not quantitatively, but only qualitatively. And because human personalities express themselves in acts that cannot be predicted, Bergson declares free will to be an observable fact. Students and teachers of philosophy are sure to welcome this inexpensive reprint of Bergson's classic, influential essay, long a staple of college philosophy courses.</p><p>Kessinger Publishing reprints over 1,500 similar titles all available through Amazon.com.Bergson won the Nobel Prize in literature in 1927.</p><h2>Golden Dawn Tarot Deck</h2><p>Based on the notebooks and records of the Order of the Golden Dawn, these cards include references to symbolism of diverse origins.</p><p></p><h2>Emotional Purity: An Affair of the Heart (Includes Study Questions)</h2><p><p>Have you ever given your heart to someone who didn't love you back?</p><p>Do you feel like you've experienced heartache over and over again?</p><p>If you are emotionally attached to someone, it's easy to cross the line and become emotionally intimate. Then if the relationship doesn't work out, you're left with scars on your heart.</p><p>The church teaches us the importance of physical purity; but it teaches little about emotional purity. Christian singles often wear their hearts on their sleeves, which can lead to intense, emotionally intimate, male-female "friendships" with no commitment to pursuing marriage. People may have had several of these "friendships" and still consider themselves pure, but in reality they have given away pieces of their hearts that should be reserved for their future spouses. Emotional Purity will show you how to define and set boundaries in your relationships to avoid making the same mistakes. Learn how to guard your heart and keep it emotionally pure.</p><p>Using fictional and real-life examples along with sound biblical advice, author Heather Arnel Paulsen outlines the pitfalls of undefined relationships and presents guidelines for living an emotionally pure life.</p></p><p><p><strong>Heather Arnel Paulsen</strong> is committed to encouraging Christian singles to pursue emotional purity, and she enjoys mentoring and counseling young women. In 2003 she married her husband, John. The couple lives in Illinois with their two young children, whom Heather looks forward to homeschooling.

Excited is my mother's normal state of mind.<br><br>The first of the girls (as she called them) had started arriving yesterday. The rest were due this morning. After settling in, they planned to tour the sights of Rudolph, New York, beginning with my store, Mrs. Claus's Treasures.<br><br>I checked my watch. Eleven thirty. "Now remember," I said to Jackie O'Reilly, my shop assistant, "these are longtime friends of my mother, but I've never met any of them before."<br><br>"Doesn't sound like such good friends to me," she said. "My mom's childhood pals are more like aunts to me than my own aunts are."<br><br>"College friends drift apart. In terms of location as well as moving on with their lives. They've kept in touch over the years with Christmas cards and the like, and some of them visited Mom in New York when she was singing. Mom and Dad stayed with one of the women when they were in California last year, but Mom says this is the first time since college that they'll all be together. Anyway, the point is, Jackie, treat them well. This weekend is really important to Mom."<br><br>"Treat them well. I'll remember that. I assume you mean not like I treat our other customers, Merry."<br><br>"That's not what I meant."<br><br>"Whatever." Jackie tucked a piece of fresh holly around a giant glass bowl piled high with silver and pink balls. "How's that look?"<br><br>I studied it. The display seemed sparse to me. "Fill the bowl up more. It should be on the verge of overflowing."<br><br>"If it overflows any more, they'll fall out."<br><br>"Another one or two will be okay." In my former life I'd been a style editor at one of the country's top lifestyle magazines. I had a good eye, and I was proud of it.<br><br>I left Jackie to it, and went to give a small nudge to a customer who'd been spending a lot of time examining the earring tree. "Those are hand-made by a local jeweler," I told her.<br><br>She picked up a pair of earrings. Delicate threads of silver had been twisted into the shape of a snowman, and a tiny red stone provided his nose. "I've been admiring the quality. They are pricey though."<br><br>"The artist's name is Crystal Wong. She's from Rudolph and is in her first year at the School of Visual Arts in New York."<br><br>"She works here part-time." Jackie placed a pink ball on top of the stack. It did look dangerously unstable. She picked up a silver orb and slowly settled it in place. The display wobbled, and she held her hands out as though to catch them if they fell. Trust Jackie to make her point, even if the entire display collapsed around us.<br><br>"You're right, Jackie," I admitted as I remembered that at a magazine shoot we often had displays tumbling around us moments after the pictures were snapped. A photographic display isn't designed for stability or permanence. "Any more balls and the whole thing's going to topple over."<br><br>She didn't bother to hide her self-satisfied expression as she removed the last two balls.<br><br>"I like knowing the name of the artist and helping support a local community at the same time," the customer said. "I'll take these for me." She handed me the snowmen and then she picked up another one of Crystal's pieces, a gold chain with double links and a small jeweled wreath at the throat. She ran the chain through her fingers and checked the price tag. "This might be a bit too much for a preholiday gift. I'll take these instead." She swapped the necklace for a pair of earrings shaped like wreaths. "For my mother-in-law. I'll call it a Thanksgiving present to get her in the mood for the holidays. I'll take some of those napkins as well. I love your tree."<br><br>"Thanks." I gave the tree an appreciative glance. A live Douglas fir, replaced once a month, fully decorated with bells and balls, ribbons and wooden cranberry strings, small, warm white lights, and a glistening silver star at the top, filled one corner of the store. This was a Christmas-themed shop, but that never stopped us from featuring other holidays at the appropriate time. Today the main display was set as if for a Thanksgiving feast, with a centerpiece of real sugar pumpkins, fresh apples, red maple leaves, an orange and brown runner with matching place mats, and turkey-themed dishes.<br><br>I took the jewelry to the sales counter while the customer continued to browse. We'd been busy this morning, but the store was emptying out as lunchtime approached.<br><br>It was the week before Thanksgiving, coming up to the busiest time of the year. At Mrs. Claus's Treasures, I specialize in locally made crafts and design elements for gift-giving and for decorating the home. The store's located on Jingle Bell Lane, the main shopping area of Rudolph, New York. The greatest desire of the townspeople and shop owners of Rudolph is to be officially designated America's Christmas Town. That hasn't happened, not yet, but we call ourselves that anyway.<br><br>Although we celebrate Christmas all year round, the weeks between Thanksgiving and New Year are the busiest, by far, and like all the owners of shops and businesses along Jingle Bell Lane, I was gearing up to do nothing but work for the next six weeks.<br><br>"Speaking of Crystal," Jackie said once the customer had left, laden with not only the two sets of earrings and Thanksgiving napkins but a porcelain Mrs. Claus doll dressed in Victorian attire, a chain of bright red wooden cranberries, and a set of the silver and pink balls. "How's she doing in New York?"<br><br>"Well, I think." Jackie and Crystal had never gotten on, perhaps because bold Jackie was filled with her own self-importance and shy Crystal was genuinely talented, but I got the feeling Jackie was proud of how well Crystal was doing. "She seems to be enjoying her classes and is making friends. She'll be home for the holidays and is going to do some shifts in here at the busy times."<br><br>"That's good," Jackie said. "I could use the help."<br><br>She spoke as though I weren't, at this very minute, rearranging the jewelry display.<br><br>The chimes over the door tinkled and my mother swept in. She'd been a soloist at the Metropolitan Opera and had retired from the stage a few years ago. Now she taught voice lessons, but she was still every inch the diva. Her look was always dramatic with her huge dark eyes and jet-black hair (these days owing more to Clairol than to her Italian mother) and still-flawless olive skin. Today she wore a black wool cape tied with a row of fire-engine red frogs and lined with scarlet silk, a matching red hat trimmed with fake black fur, and red leather knee-high boots with substantial heels.<br><br>"Darling. How lovely to see you." She wrapped me in a hug, and I was enveloped in the familiar scent of Chanel No. 5. She released me and turned with a dramatic sweep of her arms. "Girls, come and meet Merry, my eldest daughter. Merry owns this absolutely darling little shop."<br><br>The five women who filed in in my mother's wake were a mixed lot. Their clothes ranged from new, expensive, and fashionable to mass-produced, well-worn, and slightly tatty. They ranged in size from short and round to tall and lean. They were all the same age as my mom, but if I hadn't known they'd been college roommates, I might have thought their ages varied by twenty or more years.<br><br>They greeted me warmly and gushed over both me and my shop.<br><br>Mom made the introductions, and I struggled to keep the names straight:<br><br>Constance: designer jeans, three-hundred-dollar haircut, diamond earrings and rings, tall and fit, healthy winter tan<br><br>Barbara: average height but powerful-looking in khaki pants, hiking boots, cropped gray hair, a row of piercings through her right ear<br><br>Karla: short and plump with pale pudgy cheeks, cloth coat pilling around the elbows and under the sleeves, sturdy brown footwear of the sort my paternal grandmother would have called "sensible shoes"<br><br>Ruth: heavily wrinkled, bags under eyes, jeans worn in the knees and hem but not fashionably, scuffed sneakers, an aura of cigarette smoke clinging to her and her clothes<br><br>Genevieve: also smelling of smoke but faint and overlaid with perfume, taller than the rest and as thin as the branches of the earring tree, struggling to keep her age at bay with what might have been a facelift, dyed blond hair tied in a high ponytail that was far too youthful for her<br><br>Introductions over, the women spread throughout the shop. Almost immediately Constance began gathering things off the shelves and display racks. Jewelry, Thanksgiving napkins and place mats, a set of coasters showing the elves hard at work in Santa's workshop. Genevieve picked everything up, examined it, and put it back again. Karla went straight to the toys, and Barbara studied the Christmas decorations. Ruth stood against a wall, her arms crossed over her chest, and simply watched the others. A deep line had formed between her eyebrows, and she was not smiling.<br><br>"Do you know the origins of these pieces?" Barbara asked me, pointing to a brightly painted wooden nutcracker soldier that formed part of a collection.<br><br>"I can tell you almost to the square mile," I said. "The woodworker lives not far from town, and he forages in the woods for broken branches after a storm and follows the crews who maintain the electricity wires when they're trimming trees."<br><br>His name was Alan Anderson and he was my boyfriend. I didn't mention that.<br><br>"Is everything you sell here local?" she asked.<br><br>"Not everything. I source some of the finer things in the city, but I do my best to get whatever I can locally."<br><br>"Merry was a design editor with Jennifer's Lifestyle magazine," Mom said. "She has excellent taste."<br><br>"I can see that," Barbara said. "I'll take the full set of these, thanks. They'll look great decorating my office."<br><br>"What do you do?" I asked.<br><br>"I'm a lawyer. We specialize in environmental protection."<br><br>"Sounds interesting," I said.<br><br>"And important."<br><br>Karla had left the toy display and come to see the table decorations. "Interfering with businessmen trying to provide jobs and keep their community alive, more like," she said.<br><br>"That's your opinion," Barbara said.<br><br>"It's the truth."<br><br>"I'd like to hear more about what you and your firm do, Barbara," Ruth said.<br><br>Karla turned on her. "People like you, who only work for others, don't understand what it's like to be responsible for the welfare of your employees. Some of these environmental people want to bring in ridiculous petty laws that destroy hardworking family-owned businesses. You wouldn't believe the trouble and expense we have to go to before we can begin a project. All to protect some silly turtle."<br><br>Ruth lifted her hands. "I'm just asking."<br><br>"And I'm just telling you," Karla said.<br><br>I wasn't getting in the middle of that. I went behind the sales counter and began ringing up purchases while Jackie followed Constance through the shop, staggering under the weight of the other woman's selections. Ruth went to stand by the door, where she waited impatiently for the others to finish shopping.<br><br>Genevieve put a small ornament on the counter. "I'll be back later," she said to me, "and then I'll clean you out. For now, I'll get this charming fellow."<br><br>I'd noticed her trying to unobtrusively check the price tags on all the items she looked at. This little ornament, a two-inch-high wooden soldier to hang on the tree, was one of the cheapest things I sold. I wanted to tell her she didn't have to buy something she didn't really want just to please Mom, but that would come across as pretty insulting, so I said nothing.<br><br>"Why don't I treat you to a little something?" Constance was examining the jewelry display, and she called across the shop floor to Ruth. "Isn't this necklace absolutely darling? Would you like it?" She held up a chain with glass stones shaped like holiday lights.<br><br>"You don't need to do that," Ruth said.<br><br>"But I'd like to." <br><br>"No. Thank you." Ruth kept her arms folded across her chest. The line between her brows deepened.<br><br>"It's not much." Constance ran her eyes over Ruth, taking in the too-large brown jacket, the worn jeans, the scuffed sneakers. "You need a touch of holiday color about you."<br><br>My shop's not very large, and voices can easily be heard from one side to the other, but I thought Constance could have shown a bit of courtesy by approaching the person she was talking to, rather than yelling across the room so everyone could hear.<br><br>"I told you," Ruth said, "I don't want it."<br><br>"I'm only trying to be nice." Constance's tone was sweet, but a sickly sweet. Too much and without good intentions behind it. "You don't have to-"<br><br>"Lunchtime!" Mom called. "Complete your purchases, girls. I have the perfect place in mind for lunch. Merry, can you join us?" She lifted her eyebrows to the ceiling and opened her eyes wide, asking me to agree.<br><br>"Sure," I said. "That would be nice. Let me check on Mattie, and I'll follow you. Where are you going?"<br><br>"The bakery, of course. Where else would one go in Rudolph after a day of preholiday shopping?"<br><br>Except for Ruth, the women all bought something. They paid for their purchases and left. I watched them pass the front windows, heading up Jingle Bell Lane toward Victoria's Bake Shoppe. Mom led the way, chatting to Constance, who'd pulled a gigantic pair of designer sunglasses out of her Michael Kors bag as they left the shop. Barbara and Genevieve walked together, Karla behind them. Ruth came last, well behind the rest of the group.<br><br>"Are they all staying at your parents' house?" Jackie asked.<br><br>"Yes. You know how big the house is. Room enough for them all."<br><br>"How's your dad feel about that? A weekend of a houseful of women?"<br><br>"He's fine with it. Which might be because he's not here. He's gone to Florida on a fishing trip."<br><br>"Must be nice." Jackie looked out the window. The sun was out in a brilliant blue sky but the air was cold, everyone heavily wrapped in coats, scarves, and mittens. Winter was on its way.<br><br>"I'll try not to take too long at lunch." Before leaving, I went in the back to check on Matterhorn, my dog. I usually took a break around now to take him for a walk. He's a Saint Bernard, not exactly a small animal, and fully grown at just over a year old. Training's important with a dog of that size, and Mattie and I had worked hard together, with the result that he was reasonably well behaved when he wanted to be. When he didn't want to be was another matter altogether. Fortunately, most of the time he wanted to be good, and so I often brought him to work with me. Needless to say, he wasn't allowed in the shop itself ("bull in a china shop" is the phrase that comes to mind), but he was content to spend the day in the back with the occasional break for a walk, and he never barked no matter how much commotion was going on in the store.</p><h2>Looking for The Gulf Motel (Pitt Poetry Series)</h2><p><p>Family continues to be a wellspring of inspiration and learning for Blanco. His third book of poetry, <i>Looking for The Gulf Motel,</i> is a genealogy of the heart, exploring how his family&#x2019;s emotion legacy has shaped&#x2014;and continues shaping&#x2014;his perspectives. The collection is presented in three movements, each one chronicling his understanding of a particular facet of life from childhood into adulthood. As a child born into the milieu of his Cuban exiled familia, the first movement delves into early questions of cultural identity and their evolution into his unrelenting sense of displacement and quest for the elusive meaning of home. The second, begins with poems peering back into family again, examining the blurred lines of gender, the frailty of his father-son relationship, and the intersection of his cultural and sexual identities as a Cuban-American gay man living in rural Maine. In the last movement, poems focused on his mother&#x2019;s life shaped by exile, his father&#x2019;s death, and the passing of a generation of relatives, all provide lessons about his own impermanence in the world and the permanence of loss. <i>Looking for the Gulf Motel</i> is looking for the beauty of that which we cannot hold onto, be it country, family, or love.</p></p><p><p><b>Richard Blanco</b> was selected as the 2013 inaugural poet for President Barack Obama. He is the author of two other poetry collections: <i>Directions to The Beach of the Dead,</i> winner of the PEN/Beyond Margins Award; and <i>City of a Hundred Fires,</i> winner of the Agnes Lynch Starrett Poetry Prize. Exploring themes of Latino identity and place, Blanco's poems have appeared in <i>Best American Poetry 2000</i> and <i>Best American Prose Poems</i> and have been featured on NPR. He is a fellow of the Bread Loaf Writers Conference, recipient of two Florida Artist Fellowships, and has taught at Georgetown and American universities. A builder of cities and poems, Blanco is also a professional civil engineer.</p><p>&#x201c;W. H. Auden, asked to define poetry from the other written arts, wrote that poetry was &#x2018;memorable speech.&#x2019; Richard Blanco&#x2019;s speech invites the reader in with its search for home. His lyrics open doors onto his Cuban immigrant family, his father&#x2019;s early death, and his own migration from a life in Florida to a life in Maine. His speech houses a generous love of others and a persistent reach for what is absent. There is nothing here you will not remember.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Spencer Reece</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Every poem in <i>Looking for The Gulf Motel</i> packs an emotional wallop and an intellectual caress. A virtuoso of art and craft who juggles the subjective and the objective beautifully, Blanco is at the height of his creative prowess and one of the best of the best poets writing today.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Jim Elledge</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;The poems in <i>Looking for The Gulf Motel</i> are bittersweet songs that ache with the &#x2018;sweet and slow honey of a bolero.&#x2019; They croon about journeys from Cuba and Spain to Florida and Maine; mourn languages, lovers, and names that were or could have been; and praise the forgotten pop culture icons that expanded one young person&#x2019;s view of his nationality and manhood. If all loss is like exile, Blanco tells us, then searching for love (in the self, in others) is healing, is finding home, because &#x2018;love is thicker than any country.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Rigoberto Gonz�lez</p><br><br><p> &#x201c;The main thing about Blanco&#x2019;s poems is how lyrical his voice is and how universal his themes, how easily we can relate to his concerns.&#x201d;</p><p><i>&#x2015;Chamber Four</i></p><br><br><p> "These are poems of poetic beauty and heart, confession and acceptance, courage and love.

Some solutions are also offered, good ideas like planting trees, riding bikes instead of driving, and buying foods that aren't prepackaged. Global warming criticism gets about a half page of rebuttal, but Rockwell notes, even if the critics are right, it is still a good idea to try to stop the increase of greenhouse gasses.

Writing candidly about her upbringing and early years and the formation of her character and values, she details the experiences that propelled her to the very top in a man's world. She offers a riveting firsthand history of the major events, the crises and triumphs, during her eleven years as prime minister, including the Falklands War, the Brighton hotel bombing, the Westland affair, the final years of the Cold War, and her unprecedented three election victories.

Thus Holmes greets the two travel-grimed Arab figures who receive them in the orange groves fringing the Holy Land. Whatever role could the volatile Ali and the taciturn Mahmoud play in Mycroft's design for this land the British so recently wrested from the Turks? After passing a series of tests, Holmes and Russell learn their guides are engaged in a mission for His Majesty's Government, and disguise themselves as Bedouins--Russell as the beardless youth "Amir"--to join them in a stealthy reconnaissance through the dusty countryside.<br><br>A recent rash of murders seems unrelated to the growing tensions between Jew, Moslem, and Christian, yet Holmes is adamant that he must reconstruct the most recent one in the desert gully where it occurred. His singular findings will lead him and Russell through labyrinthine bazaars, verminous inns, cliff-hung monasteries--and into mortal danger. When her mentor's inquiries jeopardize his life, Russell fearlessly wields a pistol and even assays the arts of seduction to save him. Bruised and bloodied, the pair ascend to the jewellike city of Jerusalem, where they will at last meet their adversary, whose lust for savagery and power could reduce the city's most ancient and sacred place to rubble and ignite this tinderbox of a land....<br><br>Classically Holmesian yet enchantingly fresh, sinuously plotted, with colorful characters and a dazzling historic ambience, <b>O Jerusalem</b> sweeps readers ever onward in the thrill of the chase.</p><p>Although <i>O Jerusalem</i> is Laurie King's fifth book in her Holmes-Russell series, it actually takes us back to the era of her first book, <i>The Beekeeper's Apprentice</i>. Perhaps King was afraid that her characters, Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes, were becoming too cozy as an old married couple, and she wanted to recreate the edgy sexual tension of their first encounter. <p> It's 1918. Nineteen-year-old Mary and her fiftysomething mentor are forced to flee England to escape a deadly adversary. Sherlock's well-connected brother Mycroft sends them to Palestine to do some international sleuthing. Here, a series of murders threatens the fragile peace. </p><p> Laurie King connects us, through details of language, custom, history, and sensual impressions, to this very alien environment. Russell, Holmes, and two marvelously imagined Arab guides named Mahmoud and Ali trek through the desert and visit ancient monasteries clinging like anthills to cliffs. They also find time to take tea with the British military legend Allenby in Haifa and skulk through or under the streets of Jerusalem. King puts us into each scene so quickly and completely that her narrative flow never falters.</p><p> Stepping back in time also gives King a chance to show us Holmes through the eyes of a Russell not yet as full of love as a honeymooner, nor as complacent as a comfortable wife. "There it was--sardonic, superior, infuriating," Mary says about Holmes's voice at one point. </p><p> Wisdom is knowing when, and how much, to shake things up--even in a successful series.

He has practiced and taught the Shaolin arts for more than 3 decades and has more than 60,000 students all over the world.</p>Yet, the best application of kungfu is not just to fight. The qualities of a good fighter that we develop in kungfu training - like courage, calmness, sound judgment, fluidity of movements and mental freshness - can be applied to make life more rewarding and meaningful for ourselves and for other people. --Chapter 5: Poetry of Strength and Courage (The Philosophy and Dimension of Shaolin Kungfu) - The Four Dimensions of Kungfu<br><br>Practising chi kung clears energy blockage, especially at the cellular and sub-atomic levels, with the beneficial effects gradually spreading to the levels of tissues, organs, and the whole body including the mind. When vital energy is increased and its flow harmonious, yin-yang balance is achieved. --Chapter 19: Curing Incurable Diseases (Shaolin Chi Kung and Chinese Medicine) - How Does Chi Kung Cure Illness<br><br>In theory, Zen is the easiest. If you are ready, and just do this correctly - sit comfortably in a lotus position, close your eyes and keep your mind blank - you will achieve enlightenment, i.e. the greatest achievement any being can achieve, in an instant! But in actual practice, this approach may be the most difficult. It may sound odd, but sitting comfortably itself may not be easy! Some people cannot even sit comfortably on a chair; they feel restless after only a few minutes. Sitting in a lotus position, even if they are prepared to put up with some discomfort, is difficult for most untrained adults. Keeping the mind blank is worse; some people have told me it was the most difficult thing they had ever attempted. --Chapter 26: The Beauty and Profundity of Zen (Some Philosophical Considerations for Zen Training) - The Easiest or the Most Difficult</p><h2>Search For The Real Self : Unmasking The Personality Disorders Of Our Age</h2><p>From the authoritative expert in personality disorders, <i>Search for the Real Self</i> is a thorough dissection of how one&#x2019;s real self is developed, how it relates to the outer world, and how personality disorders are understood and treated in our modern society.<br><br>Personality disorders&#x2014;borderline, narcissistic, and schizoid&#x2014;have become the classic psychological disorders of our age. Outwardly successful, charming and powerful, personality-disordered individuals have long confounded their colleagues, family, lovers and employees&#x2014;as well as mental health professionals. The author helps the reader understand them. After describing how the healthy real self develops and functions, he explains what can go wrong. Drawing on case histories, he shows how the false self behaves in relationships and on the job, and then delineates appropriate treatments, offering real hope for cure.</p><p>A prominent psychiatrist, James F.

A black steamer trunk appeared at Euston Square Station some</p>time during the night and remained unnoticed until early afternoon of the following day. The porter discovered it after the one o&#x2019;clock train had departed, and he opened the trunk when it proved too heavy for him to lift.<p></p><p>He immediately sent a boy to find the police.</p><p>Detective Inspector Walter Day was first at the scene, and he directed the many bobbies who arrived after him. He had come to London only the week before. This was his first crime scene and he was clearly nervous, but the blue-uniformed bobbies knew their job well and did not require much from him. They pushed back the commuters who had gathered round the trunk and began to scour the station for possible weapons and other clues.</p><p>An hour later, Dr Bernard Kingsley entered the station all in a rush and headed for the knot of people gathered on the gallery of the booking office. The trunk had been left against the railing overlooking the platform. Kingsley brushed past Inspector Day and knelt on the floor.</p><p>He opened his satchel and drew out a cloth tape measure, snaked it between his fingers, moving it up and across. The trunk was a standard size, two by three by three, glossy black with tin rivets along the seams. He closed the lid and brushed a finger across the top. It was clean; no dust.</p><p>With his magnifying glass in hand, he scuttled around the trunk, scru</p>tinizing the corners for wear. He licked his finger and rubbed a seam along one side where black paint had been applied to cover a crack. He was aware of Day hovering over his shoulder and, less intrusive, the bobbies at the sta<p></p>tion&#x2019;s entrance pushing back fresh onlookers who had arrived from the street outside. The lower classes were always out for a spectacle, while the better-off walked briskly past, ignoring the to-do.<p></p><p>His preliminary examination out of the way, Kingsley opened and shut the trunk&#x2019;s lid several times, listening to the hinges, then eased it back until the edge of the lid rested against the floor. He peered into the trunk for a long moment, ignoring the sickly sweet odor of death. The body inside was folded in on itself, knotted and mashed into the too-small space like so much laundry. One shoe was missing, and Kingsley presumed it was some</p>where at the bottom of the trunk, under the body. The man&#x2019;s suit was gabardine, the hems lightly worn, dirt pressed into the creases. His arms and legs were broken and wrapped around one another.<p></p><p>Kingsley took a pair of tongs from his satchel and used them to move an arm out of the way so he could see the man&#x2019;s face. The skin was pearl grey and the eyes and mouth were sewn shut with heavy thread, the pattern of parallel stitches like train tracks across the man&#x2019;s lips. Kingsley looked up at Day. When he spoke, his voice was low and measured.</p><p>&#x201c;Have you identified him yet?&#x201d;</p><p>Day shook his head no.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s one of you,&#x201d; Kingsley said.</p><p>&#x201c;One of me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The body is that of a detective. This is Inspector Little.&#x201d;</p><p>Day backed away to the railing and held up his hands, warding off the unpleasant thought.</p><p>&#x201c;It can&#x2019;t be. I spoke with Little just last evening.&#x201d;</p><p>Kingsley shrugged.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not that I doubt you,&#x201d; Day said. &#x201c;But Inspector Little . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Come and see for yourself,&#x201d; Kingsley said.</p><p>Day stared at him.</p><p>&#x201c;I said come here. Please.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;</p><p>Day approached the trunk and swallowed hard before looking down.</p><p>&#x201c;Breathe through your mouth, Mr Day. The odor isn&#x2019;t pleasant.&#x201d;</p><p>Day nodded, panting heavily.</p><p>&#x201c;I suppose it is Mr Little. But what have they done to him?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You can see what&#x2019;s been done. The question is why has it been done?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s inhuman.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid it&#x2019;s all too human.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Cut those off him. Get that off his face. We can&#x2019;t have a detective of the Yard trussed up like a . . . like a Christmas goose, for God&#x2019;s sake.&#x201d;</p><p>One of the uniformed constables standing at the rail looked up. The station was full of citizens who didn&#x2019;t care about the dead detective in the trunk just so long as they got a chance to see him. Day recognized the ter</p>ror in the constable&#x2019;s eyes and could see that he had no idea why he was doing this dangerous job for little money and no respect. In that single mo<p></p>ment, in the expression he saw in the other man&#x2019;s eyes, Day understood that London needed her police, but did not care about them. And he saw, too, that this newfound discovery was something that every policeman on that platform already understood.<p></p><p>The morale of the Metropolitan Police Force had reached its lowest point during the Ripper murders of the previous year and had not yet re</p>covered. The files of the Whitechapel murders had not been closed as the case was still ongoing, but nobody in London trusted the police to do their job. Jack had escaped and the detectives of the Yard had never even come close to finding him. The unsolved case was a harsh reminder of their fal<p></p>libility, and it hung over their heads every morning when they walked through the door of the back hall. The Ripper was still out there some<p></p>where, and it was likely he&#x2019;d remain out there.<p></p><p>Kingsley stood and put a hand on Day&#x2019;s shoulder. When he spoke, his voice was barely audible.</p><p>&#x201c;I will most assuredly make Inspector Little presentable again. There will be a time and a place to mourn him. Here and now, you must fix your mind on justice. It is not outside the realm of possibility that Little&#x2019;s killer is watching us, and your demeanor may set the course for the investigation to come. You must appear to be strong and rational.&#x201d;</p><p>Day nodded.</p><p>&#x201c;To work, then,&#x201d; Kingsley said.</p><p>He grabbed a handle and lifted one end of the trunk, grunted, and set it back down.</p><p>&#x201c;Inspector Day,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;you look like an able fellow. Lift this end, would you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where shall I put it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not the entirety of the trunk, just pull upward on the handle and get this thing off the ground a bit, would you?&#x201d;</p><p>Kingsley removed his hat and set it on a bench along the far wall of the gallery. He draped his coat over the arm of the bench and strode back to where Day had an end of the trunk lifted off the ground. The two men were a study in contrasts. Dr Kingsley was short and thin with sharply chiseled features and wild, prematurely grey hair that matched his eyes. Inspector Day was tall and built like an ox through the chest and shoulders. His short dark hair was combed back from his wide forehead, and his expression was permanently helpful, as if he were in search of an old lady he might escort across the street. He displayed the easy physical confidence that some big men had, but his features were fine and sensitive and his eyes were sad. Kingsley found it impossible to dislike the young detective.</p><p>&#x201c;Higher, would you?&#x201d; Kingsley said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s better.&#x201d;</p><p>He got down on his hands and knees and crawled under the end of the trunk, Day straining above him. It didn&#x2019;t occur to him that Day might drop the trunk on his head. Men like Day used their brains to move their mus</p>cles about. Their muscles were useful enough.<p></p><p>Kingsley inspected the planks of the platform floor, peering into crevices in the ancient wood, worn smooth by the shoes of countless travelers.</p><p>&#x201c;Aha!&#x201d; he said. He scrambled backward until his head was clear of the bottom of the trunk and stood up, using one hand to smooth his waistcoat over his stomach. The thumb and index finger of his other hand were pinched together, and he held them up to the light.</p><p>Day squinted.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a hair,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;No, lad. It&#x2019;s a thread. This end is frayed a bit where it&#x2019;s been cut. Here, you see?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The same thread used to sew his mouth and eyes?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Different color. That was black. This is dark blue. It could be a coinci</p>dence, someone lost a thread from her coat, perhaps, but I don&#x2019;t think so. I think your killer came prepared with at least two colors of thread. And why would that be?&#x201d;<p></p><p>He abruptly dropped to the ground and began to crawl around the plat</p>form, his magnifying glass playing over the surface, his long fingers poking into the corners where the wall joined the planks of the floor. After several long minutes in which the onlookers behind the railing began to grow rest<p></p>less, Kingsley murmured an exclamation and held his finger up to the light. A drop of blood formed on his fingertip, and Kingsley smiled. He sucked the blood from his finger and turned his magnifying glass around, using the blunt handle to scrape dirt away from the wall.<p></p><p>He stood and trotted back to where Day was still holding up an end of the trunk. Kingsley held out his hand, displaying his find for Day to see.</p><p>&#x201c;Needles,&#x201d; Day said.</p><p>Kingsley grinned. &#x201c;Three needles, Inspector Day. Three, where one might do. I&#x2019;d say our killer&#x2019;s made a telling mistake. Give me your hand</p>kerchief.&#x201d;<p></p><p>&#x201c;Is it in my breast pocket?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see one there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I may have come out without it today.&#x201d;</p><p>Kingsley nodded and turned to the nearest constable.</p><p>&#x201c;You there, have you a handkerchief ?&#x201d;</p><p>A tall, lanky constable looked up from the side of the platform where he seemed to be scanning the crowd. His eyes were bright and intelligent and nearly hidden behind long feminine lashes. He jumped slightly at the sound of Kingsley&#x2019;s voice.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d; Kingsley said.</p><p>&#x201c;Hammersmith, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You sound Welsh, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re watching the crowd?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What the detective said, about it being another detective in the box, it surprised people.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You were looking to see who among that crowd wasn&#x2019;t surprised. Who might have already known there was a detective in the trunk.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t see anything unexpected.&#x201d;</p><p>Kingsley nodded. &#x201c;Still,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;it was a worthy idea. How long have you been with the force?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Two years, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m surprised I haven&#x2019;t made your acquaintance before this. I shall watch your career with interest. Now, I wonder if I might borrow your handkerchief?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you, Mr Hammersmith.&#x201d;</p><p>Kingsley took the offered kerchief and glanced at it. He looked up at the constable.</p><p>&#x201c;This is not particularly clean.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I apologize, sir. I&#x2019;ve been at it now for two shifts and haven&#x2019;t had a chance to launder anything.&#x201d;</p><p>Indeed, Hammersmith looked sloppy. His blue uniform was wrinkled, his shirt was untucked on one side, and the cuffs of his trousers were muddy. There was a hangdog air about him, but in his body language and bearing he somehow gave the impression of utter competence.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, well, thank you, Hammersmith. I shall return this as soon as I possibly can.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>Kingsley wrapped the needles in the soiled square of cloth. He tucked the handkerchief and the short piece of blue thread into his vest pocket to be examined later.</p><p>&#x201c;This one is a challenge. A real challenge.&#x201d;</p><p>Kingsley smiled and scanned the platform one last time, barely taking in the crowd of onlookers.</p><p>&#x201c;Wonderful,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Simply wonderful. You can let that down now.&#x201d;</p><p>Day eased the end of the heavy trunk back to the platform floor and breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>&#x201c;Have two of the men bring that round to the college,&#x201d; Kingsley said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll want to examine Little&#x2019;s body, but I&#x2019;m not going to do it here. Have the rest of these bobbies search the platform carefully for a man&#x2019;s left shoe. I suspect it&#x2019;s in the trunk, but there&#x2019;s no harm in putting them to work.&#x201d;</p><p>Kingsley shrugged back into his coat, picked up his hat, and walked away. Halfway to the far edge of the platform, he turned and walked back to where Day still stood. He leaned in and whispered so the onlookers wouldn&#x2019;t overhear. &#x201c;Shut the lid on that trunk,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t want that rabble ogling a dead detective.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>A Field Guide to Antietam: Experiencing the Battlefield through Its History, Places, and People</h2><p>The Battle of Antietam took place on September 17, 1862, and still stands as the bloodiest single day in American military history.

Eschewing the one-size-fits-all leadership model, this helpful guide outlines four general leadership types and demonstrates how each type achieves success &#x2013; whether through personal vision, structured process, collaboration, or by empowering others. The authors identify the actions and skills that distinguish strategic leadership, drawn from interviews and focus groups with over three hundred leaders from around the world. Examples and case studies illustrate these concepts in action, and the provided reference materials steer readers toward more advanced information on this important topic.</p> <p>The disruptive forces of technology and globalization raise new challenges for leaders. This book is a manual that will help executives and aspiring leaders harness these forces and address the two central questions of strategic leadership:</p> <ul> <li>How do the best leaders develop their strategy?</li> <li>How do effective leaders drive strategic change?</li> </ul> <p>Becoming a strategic leader isn&#x2019;t about mimicking an icon. The most effective leaders seize opportunity in a way that consciously integrates environmental requirements, stakeholder expectations, and personal ability. <i>Leading with Strategic Thinking</i> shows what these leaders do, and gives anyone the tools to be a more strategic leader.</p></p><p><p>There are countless books on strategic thinking, and even more on leadership. But so far none have effectively integrated these two topics into a practical guide for leaders who want to promote strategic thinking within their organizations. <i>Leading with Strategic Thinking</i> fills this gap with a focus on taking action. This book also redefines strategy, bringing together insights from cognitive psychology, systems theory, and other fields to show that the importance of strategic thought transcends planning and permeates every aspect and every level of business. </p><p>Too often, leaders think of strategy as one item on a long list of tasks they must attend to. Developing strategic plans is important, but long-term value creation does not and cannot end there. Instead, strategy is a frame of mind. And it is becoming all the more important in our era of technological and social disruptions. These changes in the status quo create massive opportunities for collaboration, innovation, and advancement. <i>Leading with Strategic Thinking</i> will show you how to recognize these opportunities daily, and how to achieve strategic buy-in among line managers and employees. By assimilating strategy into the every day, leaders have the potential to vastly improve organization-wide outcomes. </p><p>Effective leaders understand that, as circumstances evolve, so do the roles of executives and upper management. Thankfully, <i>Leading with Strategic Thinking</i> does not promote a one-size-fits all leadership approach. Instead, the authors describe four types of strategic leadership, each one of which can be adapted to particular situations. Examples and case studies show how real leaders have used these techniques to improve results. The authors' insightful discussion will help you identify your own personal leadership strengths and use these to drive the right change at the right time. </p><p>Applying strategic thought to dynamic environments requires an understanding of how to drive strategy by utilizing skills that are appropriate to the moment. The authors of <i>Leading with Strategic Thinking</i> distinguish between <i>core competencies</i> and <i>applied competencies</i>&#x2013;a distinction that leaders will find enormously helpful as they respond to the demands of their specific environments. With the help of the tools and resources in this book, you can begin applying this strategic leadership framework right away.Whether embarking on a new project or seeking to improve overall performance, <i>Leading with Strategic Thinking</i> should inspire you to have a greater impact, today and into the future.</p><p><b>PRAISE FOR LEADING WITH STRATEGIC THINKING</b> </p><p>&#x201c;This is an essential guide to understanding how to think and lead strategically.

But right now, right here, all I could do was perch myself up on my elbow and enjoy as my husband strutted around our bedroom as if he were looking for something. He wasn&#x2019;t looking for a doggone thing; Tyrone was just giving me a show.<br> <br>And what a show it was, &#x2019;cause there is nothing like a naked, carved, then chiseled to perfection, chocolate man.<br> <br>I sighed and my heart swelled with even more love than I ever thought possible. I didn&#x2019;t know it could be like this. Didn&#x2019;t know it could be like this after sixteen years of marriage. Didn&#x2019;t know it could be like this after the betrayal of infidelity.<br> <br>&#x201c;What are you staring at?&#x201d; Tyrone&#x2019;s voice broke through my thoughts. He flexed his pecs and inside, I moaned. &#x201c;What? What are you looking at?&#x201d; he asked again.<br> <br>Really? He was standing there, full frontal, and he was asking me what I was looking at? Did he want me to describe the human statue of excellence that he was to me?<br> <br>I answered my husband. &#x201c;Nothing. I&#x2019;m not looking at anything.&#x201d;<br> <br>He busted out laughing, then leaned over and kissed my forehead.<br> <br>I tugged at his arm, trying to pull him down on top of me so that I could do more nasty things to him. If our life were a book, it would&#x2019;ve been titled Love and Sex. It had started with the marriage counselor that my best friend, Syreeta, had referred us to after &#x201c;the cheating incident.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Stay in the bed,&#x201d; the counselor had advised. &#x201c;You have to connect again with one another sexually. Once you get the trust back in bed, because that&#x2019;s where it was broken, you&#x2019;ll be able to get the trust back in every other aspect of your life.&#x201d;<br> <br>That had just sounded like some man talking at the time. And trust me, it had been hard on both of us. But after a couple of months, we needed therapy to get us out of bed. It was like we couldn&#x2019;t stop. And the counselor had been right. We connected again, in bed first, and everything else followed.<br> <br>But even though my husband was always down for second and third sexual helpings, this time he pulled back and I frowned.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be right back.&#x201d; Turning away, he grabbed his bathrobe from the chaise. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to check on Marquis. Make sure his homework is done and he&#x2019;s getting ready to turn in.&#x201d;<br> <br>I bounced back in the bed and sighed. &#x201c;Tyrone . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t start, Janice.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s barely nine o&#x2019;clock and you&#x2019;re sending him to bed? He&#x2019;s seventeen! Come on, now. When are you going to let up on him?&#x201d;<br> <br>The expression of pure pleasure that had been on my husband&#x2019;s face just a minute before faded fast. &#x201c;Let up on him?&#x201d; Tyrone grumbled. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re raising a black boy in a white world. I will never let up. I will never go easy. We&#x2019;ve got just one chance to get this right.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I get that,&#x201d; I said, having heard this lecture so many times. But if he was going to give me his speech, then he was going to once again listen to mine.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s been a month since he was suspended. And he&#x2019;s done everything that we&#x2019;ve asked him to do. All he does is go to school and then come home. He&#x2019;s back on track.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;See, that&#x2019;s my point right there,&#x201d; Tyrone said, jabbing his finger in the air. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s back on track. He should never have been derailed in the first place and I want to make sure that he never gets derailed again.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But what else do you want from him? We&#x2019;ve got to let him know that there is redemption after repentance. We&#x2019;ve got to teach him that he can do something wrong, but then he can make up for it by doing something right.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s a black boy. In this country, he won&#x2019;t get a makeup opportunity. In this country, he won&#x2019;t be given a second chance, and our son has to learn that lesson now.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That may be how it is in this country,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;But we&#x2019;ve got to let him know that it&#x2019;s not like that in this house. At home, he has to know that we trust him again.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tyrone shook his head.<br> <br>&#x201c;It was one joint, Tyrone,&#x201d; I said for what had to be the millionth time since our son had received that three-day school suspension a month ago. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t make it out to be any bigger than that.&#x201d; When Tyrone opened his mouth to lecture me more, I added, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t forget you smoked when you were in high school.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, but now that I know better, I&#x2019;ve done better. And I wasn&#x2019;t at Winchester Academy when I smoked. I wasn&#x2019;t at some highfalutin school where the people there were expecting and waiting for me to fail.&#x201d;<br> <br>I sighed as Tyrone went on and on about how our son&#x2019;s mistake was much worse since he was at Winchester&#x2014;one of the top college-prep academies in the country. It had been my idea to send Marquis there since I recognized his brilliance from when he was in my womb. Seriously, though, our son was smart and I wanted my only child to have the best opportunities, to give him a future that I could&#x2019;ve never imagined for myself when I was growing up motherless, fatherless, oftentimes feeling homeless as I was shuffled from one foster home to the next.<br> <br>&#x201c;You know I&#x2019;m right, Janice.&#x201d; Tyrone broke through my thoughts. &#x201c;Those white folks don&#x2019;t want him there, and he goes around acting a fool.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He was acting like a seventeen-year-old . . .&#x201d; I held up my hand before Tyrone could pounce on my words. &#x201c;And yes, he was wrong,&#x201d; I continued. &#x201c;But he&#x2019;s learned his lesson and all I want you to see is that Marquis is a good kid. A really good kid who&#x2019;s going to do great things in life.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know he has that potential. But if he&#x2019;s going to be great, he has to understand that he can&#x2019;t get caught up. He has to do everything right.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Everything right? Really?&#x201d; It took all that was inside of me not to shake my head and roll my eyes at this man. Sometimes Tyrone spoke as if he were the only parent with dreams for our son, but I wanted the same, perhaps even more, for Marquis. While Tyrone focused on his academics, accepting nothing less than straight A&#x2019;s, I focused on the fullness of the life that I prayed Marquis would have. I wanted him to be well educated, but happy, with a wife and plenty of children who called me Grandma. I wanted to see him grow up doing the things he loved, playing the saxophone and piano, writing poetry, and participating in amateur golf tournaments.<br> <br>But none of that extracurricular stuff mattered to Tyrone. He was a strict disciplinarian who walked a straight military line. I understood structure and parental control; it was just that sometimes, Tyrone was so strict, even I felt stifled.<br> <br>&#x201c;I am letting up a little bit,&#x201d; Tyrone said as if he heard my thoughts. &#x201c;I let him go out tonight, didn&#x2019;t I?&#x201d;<br> <br>I couldn&#x2019;t help it; I laughed. &#x201c;You let him go to the library!&#x201d;<br> <br>Tyrone grinned with me. &#x201c;I let him go to the library . . . with Heather,&#x201d; he said, referring to our son&#x2019;s girlfriend.<br> <br>While those words made Tyrone smile, the thought made me want to shout, and I wasn&#x2019;t talking about shouting hallelujah! This discussion was going fine&#x2014;why did Tyrone even have to bring up Marquis&#x2019;s girlfriend? His white girlfriend. She was the only thing that made me regret busting my butt, working those extra shifts at the post office so that we could send Marquis to Winchester.<br> <br>&#x201c;I guess you don&#x2019;t have nothin&#x2019; to say now, huh?&#x201d; Tyrone chuckled.<br> <br>My husband was torturing me and he knew it. He knew how I felt about Marquis bringing that girl home when there were all these beautiful black girls that he knew from growing up in church, and even a few at Winchester. Every day, I brought up a new name to him, but Marquis could not be moved. I have no idea where I went wrong, but sometime after Marquis became a teenager, he suddenly and only had eyes for girls who looked like Snow White.<br> <br>It sickened me, though his son&#x2019;s preference for girls with blond hair and blue eyes didn&#x2019;t seem to bother Tyrone. I didn&#x2019;t get that. My husband was always talking about white people this and white people that and how he lived in this country, but he was not of this country. Well, why didn&#x2019;t he have an issue with his son dating a white girl?<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, I won&#x2019;t tell him that he has to turn in,&#x201d; Tyrone said, saving me from myself. Because thoughts of Heather were getting me riled up. Now that Tyrone had mentioned Heather, I was beginning to think maybe we should keep Marquis on lockdown (and away from that white girl) until he left for college in the fall.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; I said to Tyrone.<br> <br>&#x201c;But I&#x2019;m still gonna talk to him. Make sure that his head is on straight since I did let him go out earlier. And I&#x2019;m going to talk to him about the suspension . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>This time I did roll my eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;Make sure he understands the seriousness of it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He does.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Make sure he knows it could&#x2019;ve messed with his scholarship to UPenn.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He knows.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Make sure he understands why he won&#x2019;t be valedictorian now, even though he earned it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He understands.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, if you can guarantee that he knows all of that, then he&#x2019;s off lockdown.&#x201d; Tyrone shook his head. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a softy, you know.&#x201d; He kissed me again as he tied his robe. &#x201c;Our son better thank you, &#x2019;cause if you weren&#x2019;t so cute . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>I laughed, but then stopped suddenly when the doorbell rang and a hard knock followed.<br> <br>Tyrone and I frowned together. It was just a little after nine now, and I couldn&#x2019;t imagine who would be coming by our home. Marquis and his friends knew that they couldn&#x2019;t hang out on school nights, even when Marquis wasn&#x2019;t on lockdown.<br> <br>No more than a couple of seconds passed before the visitor on the other side of our front door rang the bell again and then another knock.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who can that be?&#x201d; I asked, pushing myself up from the bed.<br> <br>Tyrone held up his hand. &#x201c;You stay here. I&#x2019;ll get it.&#x201d;<br> <br>But before my husband could make it to the top of the staircase, I had wrapped myself inside my robe and stepped into the hallway. Marquis&#x2019;s bedroom door was closed, which was the only reason why I was sure he hadn&#x2019;t bounced down the stairs to get to the door before his father.<br> <br>By the time I made my way to the top of the stairs, Tyrone was at the bottom and opening the door.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mr. Johnson?&#x201d;<br> <br>The door was open wide enough for me to see the two policemen, one black, one white, standing shoulder to shoulder, looking like soldiers.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; my husband said, his voice two octaves deeper now, the way it always dropped when he stood in front of men wearing uniforms.<br> <br>&#x201c;May we come in?&#x201d; the black one asked.<br> <br>Those words made me descend the stairs even though I wasn&#x2019;t properly dressed for company. Not that two policemen showing up in the middle of the night could ever be called welcome visitors.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s this about?&#x201d; My husband asked the question for both of us.<br> <br>The policemen stepped inside, though Tyrone hadn&#x2019;t extended an invitation. Both men glanced up at me as I stood on the second stair, gripping the lapels of my bathrobe to make sure it didn&#x2019;t open and trying to come up with a single reason why two officers would be in our home.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d; It seemed that the black officer had been assigned to do all the talking as the white one just nodded at me.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s this about?&#x201d; Tyrone asked again.<br> <br>They still stood shoulder to shoulder, at attention, as if this were a formal visitation. &#x201c;Would you mind if we went in there?&#x201d; The black officer twisted slightly, nodding toward our living room. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like for us to sit down.&#x201d;<br> <br>If the officer had been speaking to me, I would&#x2019;ve said yes just because it seemed like the right thing to do.<br> <br>But Tyrone said, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not necessary; just tell me what this is about,&#x201d; because that was right to him. My husband had been raised on the hard streets of Philly, where a policeman, no matter his color, was never an invited guest.<br> <br>The officers exchanged glances before the black one said, &#x201c;Marquis Johnson, is that your son?&#x201d;<br> <br>Tyrone&#x2019;s eyes narrowed while mine widened.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s this about?&#x201d; It felt like that was the fiftieth time my husband asked that question, and now I needed to hear the answer, too.<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s been a shooting . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, my God,&#x201d; I gasped, and covered my mouth. &#x201c;Did something happen to one of our son&#x2019;s friends?&#x201d;<br> <br>The officers looked at each other again before the black one continued, &#x201c;No. It&#x2019;s your son, Marquis. He&#x2019;s been shot.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Tyrone and I said together.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s impossible,&#x201d; Tyrone continued. &#x201c;Marquis is upstairs. He&#x2019;s in his room.&#x201d; And then he yelled out, &#x201c;Marquis, come down here.&#x201d;<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t let even a second pass before I dashed up the stairs, taking them two at a time, moving like I hadn&#x2019;t in years. Not that I had any doubt. Of course Marquis was in his bedroom. He&#x2019;d come home while Tyrone and I . . . had been spending some personal time together. I mean, he hadn&#x2019;t come into our bedroom, but he never did when we had the door closed.<br> <br>Tonight, he&#x2019;d been home by eight, nine at the latest. I was sure of that.<br> <br>Since Marquis had become a teenager, I never entered his room without knocking. But tonight, I busted in. And then I stood there . . . in the dark. I stood there staring at the blackness, though there was enough light from the hallway for me to see that Marquis wasn&#x2019;t sitting at his desk, he wasn&#x2019;t lying on his bed, he wasn&#x2019;t here.<br> <br>&#x201c;Marquis,&#x201d; I called out anyway, then rushed back into the hall and headed to the bathroom. &#x201c;Marquis!&#x201d; Just like with his bedroom, I busted into the bathroom and stared at the empty space.<br> <br>It was only then that I felt my heart pounding, though I&#x2019;m sure the assault on my chest began the moment the policeman had told that lie that my son had been shot.<br> <br>&#x201c;Marquis,&#x201d; I called out as I jerked back the shower curtain that revealed an empty tub.<br> <br>&#x201c;Marquis,&#x201d; I shouted as I now searched our guest bedroom. No one, nothing there.<br> <br>I returned to his bedroom, turned on his light, then swung open the door to his closet before I crouched down and searched under his bed. &#x201c;Marquis,&#x201d; I screamed as I went into my bedroom, wondering why my son was playing this game of hide-and-seek, something we hadn&#x2019;t done since he was four. When he finally came out of hiding, he was going to have to deal with me!<br> <br>I rushed back into the hallway and bumped right into Tyrone.<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s not up here,&#x201d; I said to my husband as he grasped my arms. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s downstairs somewhere. Did you check the kitchen? Wait, I know,&#x201d; I continued, without letting my husband speak. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s in the family room. I know you said he couldn&#x2019;t watch the TV in there, but you were about to take him off lockdown anyway and you know that Marquis&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Janice.&#x201d; Tyrone shook me a little.<br> <br>I looked up into Tyrone&#x2019;s eyes, which were glassy with tears.<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; I frowned. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t believe those policemen, do you?&#x201d;<br> <br>He nodded at the same time that I shook my head.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, they&#x2019;re lying.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re not lying,&#x201d; Tyrone said softly. &#x201c;They showed me a picture, just to make sure.&#x201d;<br> <br>Now I whipped my head from side to side because I didn&#x2019;t want to hear anything else from Tyrone. I couldn&#x2019;t believe that he would accept the word of two men in blue. Wasn&#x2019;t he the one who always said that you couldn&#x2019;t trust the police?<br> <br>Well, if he wasn&#x2019;t going to look for our son, I was. &#x201c;Marquis!&#x201d; I screamed.<br> <br>Tyrone still nodded, and now a single t...</p><h2>The Dilbert Principle: A Cubicle's-Eye View of Bosses, Meetings, Management Fads &amp; Other Workplace Afflictions</h2><p><p>The creator of <em>Dilbert</em>, the fastest-growing comic strip in the nation (syndicated in nearly 1000 newspapers), takes a look at corporate America in all its glorious lunacy. Lavishly illustrated with <em>Dilbert</em> strips, these hilarious essays on incompetent bosses, management fads, bewildering technological changes and so much more, will make anyone who has ever worked in an office laugh out loud in recognition. </p><p>The Dilbert Principle: The most ineffective workers will be systematically moved to the place where they can do the least damage &#x2014; management. </p><p>Since 1989, Scott Adams has been illustrating this principle each day, lampooning the corporate world through <em>Dilbert</em>, his enormously popular comic strip. In Dilbert, the potato-shaped, abuse-absorbing hero of the strip, Adams has given voice to the millions of Americans buffeted by the many adversities of the workplace. </p><p>Now he takes the next step, attacking corporate culture head-on in this lighthearted series of essays. Packed with more than 100 hilarious cartoons, these 25 chapters explore the zeitgeist of ever-changing management trends, overbearing egos, management incompetence, bottomless bureaucracies, petrifying performance reviews, three-hour meetings, the confusion of the information superhighway and more. With sharp eyes, and an even sharper wit, Adams exposes -- and skewers -- the bizarre absurdities of everyday corporate life. Readers will be convinced that he must be spying on their bosses, <em>The Dilbert Principle</em> rings so true! </p></p><p>You loved the comic strip; now read the business advice. <p> Or should that be anti-business advice? Scott Adams provides the hapless victim of re-engineering, rightsizing and Total Quality Management some strategies for fighting back, er, coping. Forced to work long hours, with no hope of a raise? Adams offers tips on maintaining parity in compensation. Along the way, Adams explains what ISO 9000 really is and assesses the irresistibility of female engineers. </p><p> The breath-taking cynicism of the strip should prepare readers for the author's no-holds-barred attack on management fads, large organizations, pointless bureaucracy and sadistic rule-makers who glory in control of office supplies. Readers of the on-line Dilbert Newsletter are familiar with the kind of e-mail Adams receives from his readers -- and may even have sent a few of those missives themselves. Along with illustrative strips, e-mail messages provide excruciating examples of corporate behavior which compel the reader to agree with Adams when he insists that "People are idiots". </p><p> The final chapter offers a model for would-be successful businesses to follow: the OA5 model. It's introduced with little fanfare, no outrageous promises and just the right amount of self-deprecation.</p>Scott Adams is the creator of <em>Dilbert,</em> the comic strip that now appears in 1,550 newspapers worldwide. His first two hardcover business books, <em>The Dilbert Principle</em> and <em>Dogbert's Top Secret Management Handbook,</em> have sold more than two million copies and have appeared on the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller list for a combined total of sixty weeks.</p><h2>God&#39;s Chaos Candidate: Donald J.

In 1993, her groundbreaking book, <i></i>, explained the illness of food addiction from the physiological origins through recovery. <br> <br>Today, obesity is on the rise. In addition to the 300,000 overweight people in this country, millions more who may not look overweight are unable to control their eating. <br> <br>Sheppard&#x2019;s follow-up book, <i>From the First Bite</i>offers the latest medical insights into food addiction coupled with time-tested, practical advice.<br> <br>Unlike other books that are very dry in nature, this book includes compelling personal stories and do&#x2019;s and don&#x2019;ts from other recovering and relapsed food addicts, including the author herself, who began her own recovery in 1967. The book explains how to avoid the physiological and situational triggers that lead to relapse; how to confront the emotional issues behind food cravings; how to establish a balanced food plan that eliminates cravings; and how to avoid hidden dangers in cleverly packaged foods. The book also includes a handy Twelve-Step workbook. <br> <br> Just as Sheppard&#x2019;s first book broke new ground, her latest work offers a critical first step for food addicts on the road to physical, emotional and spiritual recovery.</p><p>Kay Sheppard, M.A., is the best-selling author of Food Addiction: The Body Knows and From the First Bite. A licensed mental health counselor and certified eating disorders specialist, she conducts workshops for food addicts worldwide and hosts the Food Addiction Conference on AOL&#39;s Addiction and Recovery Forum.<b>Chapter One<br><br></b><b>Kay's Story&#x2015;The Author's Experience</b><br><br> <p>"Do you know you talk a lot about food and weight?" My recovery from active food addiction started with those words from a friend. Since I wasn't aware, I answered, "No, I didn't realize that." Then Janet asked another question: "Do you know there is a Twelve-Step program for that problem?" I didn't know that, either. She invited me to attend.</p> <p>Well, it was November, and no food addict in her right mind would consider going into a recovery program before the holidays. No, indeed, I would wait until January to start anew. I was no dummy; I had lots of holiday eating to do! I don't recall the holiday festivities that year, but I do remember that I purchased a box of candy for my father for Christmas&#x2015;then ate five of them before the gift got wrapped and delivered to him.</p> <p>As I was walking from the bedroom, where I had hidden the fifth box of candy in my bottom dresser drawer, to the bathroom where I planned to eat it, I had a thought. Why didn't I put this box of candy out on the coffee table and share it with my family? That was my moment of truth. There was something very wrong with bedroom storage, bathroom eating. And I felt so selfish that I had not shared. This behavior was not new. Oh, no. I had spent my whole life buying treats for others and then secretly eating them all. Why, I was so good at hiding my eating that my husband commented, "I don't know why you have a weight problem, you eat like a bird." </p> <p>My secret eating of sweets started at a fairly young age. As a small child, locked in the pantry to avoid detection, I would squeeze chocolate chips out of a tiny slit in the corner of the bag. Quietly opening the refrigerator, I would run my finger around the edge of the cake, collecting as much frosting as possible. All my nickels and dimes traveled to the corner store with me for sweet purchases. We had two corner stores, and when I got old enough to cross the street, I could get to the second one and buy ice cream cones dipped in chocolate sprinkles. What an innovation! When I found a dime at our vacation cottage, I talked my sister into rowing our boat miles to a concession stand to buy candy. I wonder if I shared with her. </p> <p>Holidays were heaven! We got huge baskets filled with treats at Easter. We baked special family recipes at Christmastime. We decorated cakes for every occasion. I was obsessed with food. By the time I was in eighth grade, I was fat. We had to shop in the "chubby" clothes department. My mother dressed us beautifully, and she really had to search to find appropriate clothes for me. I started cooking about that time, too, making meals for the family. I just loved to be around food. By the time I was in high school, I was a talented pastry chef. I planned to be a dietitian when I grew up. I didn't really know what a dietitian was, but I figured it was about food and that would be great. I never did follow through on that idea. </p> <p>At age fifteen, I went on my first diet and managed to lose twenty-two pounds by eliminating sweets and starches. This was the first of many attempts to lose weight. Around that age I started smoking my dad's cigarettes. Within a few years, I started to drink alcohol. None of these addictive substances seemed to be out of control, but I had three of them operating: food, nicotine and alcohol. Everything appeared to be manageable. I had no idea about the progression of addiction; I was in the early stages and poly-addicted. </p> <p>Alcohol was the first to become unmanageable. Not that I noticed. Denial took care of that. I was a binge drinker with a pattern of disruptive incidents followed by long periods of abstinence from alcohol. I would smoke and eat through the dry times as I got my life back together. My losses from alcohol mounted: my college education, a marriage, several jobs. By the time I found recovery, I had been institutionalized and separated from my young son. </p> <p>In 1967, I got sober and began working a recovery program. My son and I were living with my parents. My mother asked me if I realized that I ate the whole pan of brownies every Sunday. It must have been noticeable that I was an automatic eater without awareness of my actions. </p> <p>For the next ten years, I would rely on food and nicotine as my major addictive substances. During that time, my mother died of the complications of her own food addiction. She said to me the year before she died, "For the rest of my life I am going to eat the way I want to." She was surrendering to the disease. She told me that she had "given up." Mom died at age sixty-five. I had always been aware of her struggle with food. We began dieting together when I was fifteen. We tried lots of diets, drugs and programs. Nothing had worked for us.</p> <p>In 1977 Janet introduced me to a recovery plan for compulsive eaters. I just loved it. Although I threw myself into the program, it would take several years in recovery before I realized the extremely serious nature of this disease. At first for me, it was mostly a weight-loss program and fellowship with people I really liked. My sponsor guided me for the first nine months of my recovery while I completed the first Three Steps. Then she got busy in graduate school, and I neglected to find a new sponsor. We moved to the country and I was no longer as connected with my recovering friends. Fewer meetings, fewer phone calls, one too many resentments, and I was back into the food&#x2015;for one binge! That was enough to show me that I was as crazy on food as I had ever been on alcohol. It was time to get serious about recovery. I began to attend many meetings and moved forward in my Step work. It was no longer a weight-loss issue, it was a question of sanity. </p> <p>After attending graduate school, I went to work as an addictions counselor in a treatment center where there was a food addiction unit. In the therapeutic community, the intense pain caused by food addiction was more apparent than in the meeting rooms. My eyes were further opened to the serious nature of this disease. I learned a lot about food plans and addictive foods there, too. Two years later, I went on to open several food addiction programs in hospital settings for another company. It was difficult to find support for abstinence in my new location. Because the major recovery program had stopped using food plans and effective guidelines for abstinence, members were not in stable physical recovery. It was frustrating, and sometimes I left meetings feeling defeated. Eventually, abstinence-based recovery took root in the community. </p> <p>Over the years I collected a lot of information about food plans and addictive foods. Most of it came from recovering people. Many professionals offered good ideas, too. Developing an effective food plan has been a work in progress. Scientific research is catching up with us, but our best information comes from realizing what substances or situations trigger our craving. The body knows. What the body knows is this: It is sensitive to addictive substances and will always, without exception, react in an addictive manner to them. A great gift of recovery is relief from craving and obsession triggered by food substances. </p> <p>In 1988 I quit smoking, and I spent the next two years suffering from acute and post-acute withdrawal. I relied on my sponsor and the God of my understanding to get through it. Others who had agonized during nicotine withdrawal assured me, "This too shall pass." I didn't believe it, but I didn't think they would lie, either. One day at a time, I did not pick up any addictive substances. </p> <p>Nicotine was the last of my addictive substances. Without it, I had to watch my food carefully. I learned about discipline, obedience, commitment, vigilance and resolve. Alcohol, nicotine and caffeine were never in my home. However, I still had to prepare and eat food. Over the years the food processors introduced sugar and refined starches into foods that didn't need them. One food distributor told me there was a "conspiracy to get as much sugar as possible into food so that people would buy more." It became even more important to check labels. My recovery was strengthened. It was important to trust God, keep my side of the street clean, help others and work the steps. Food was a greater challenge than it had ever been before.</p> <p>Today, I continue to weigh and measure my food, plan it daily and report it often to my sponsor. When attending a social event that includes eating, I eat beforehand, take my food with me or call ahead to arrange for abstinent food. Planning is the key to physical abstinence, and for that I am responsible. I do not just "show up" and expect others to have abstinent food waiting for me. For example, recently I did a workshop in south Florida. I took my food for the two meals I would need on the day of the program and spoke in advance with my host to arrange dinner for the evening before the workshop. I was served acceptable protein and starch but had to request another vegetable. The salad served contained cheese and bacon, neither of which is on my food plan. Assertive, not aggressive, requests usually result in great cooperation from servers, friends and relatives.</p> <p>My relatives are familiar with my abstinence, and they are so cooperative. My sisters always have my kind of food available when I visit. My brother picks me up at the airport and pulls into the grocery store before we get to his home. "Get the food you need," he says. In restaurants I order dry, broiled protein, a dry baked potato, a large salad (no cheese, bacon, croutons) with oil and vinegar on the side, and water to drink. I don't use balsamic vinegar because it contains sugar. I don't use table salt because iodized salt contains sugar, too. When traveling I have all the food I will need on hand until I can get to a grocery store (every city, foreign or domestic, has one) or restaurant. I plan my travels meal by meal. I carry my scale and some condiments in my purse.</p> <p>I seek objective feedback from my sponsor when I get into personality conflicts. I am willing to follow directions. Being openminded is so much easier than suffering. I have learned that whenever I judge, criticize, blame or put expectations on others, I become a helpless, hopeless, powerless victim of my own creation. I create my own pain, my own victimhood. When I want out of it, I do my work&#x2015;which is to suspend judgment, give up expectations, stop blaming and get back to a place of love and acceptance. I call my sponsor occasionally, and I sponsor others. I attend meetings, usually daily. My goal is to do Steps Ten, Eleven and Twelve every day, always remembering the First Step&#x2015;that I am powerless over certain foods. The literature is important to me. In the morning I meditate, pray and read. In the evening I inventory, journal, resolve personality conflicts and do a gratitude list. When I am wrong I admit it, not always promptly, but it is always a relief when I do it. It takes so much energy and causes so much anguish to be "right." I understand the false idea that "I am right, you are wrong, you had better change!" causes all the fights, war and conflict in the world. By giving it up, I can resign from the conflict and enjoy peace. I would rather be happy than "right." In the world of the spirit there is no right/wrong, good/bad, could/should, only love and acceptance. That is where peace is found. </p> <p>You can't keep it unless you give it away. Love and service are the recovery principles embodied in Step Twelve. I sponsor others, make phone calls, share at meetings and carry the key to the meeting room to ensure that the door will be open to every food addict seeking recovery. E-mail, chat rooms and our recovery loop provide opportunities to share on the Internet.</p> <p>God's grace pours down upon me. All I have to do is say yes to all that he provides. He sent me countless people to help me; some told me about recovery, others taught me to meditate, still others showed me that I am the author of my own life. God's grace is always available to me, as I seek this day's reprieve from addiction. Coasting does not work. I cannot stay abstinent, clean and sober by putting anything before spiritual growth. Pain sends me scurrying for help. A very spiritual man taught me how to use pain as a spiritual path, but pain is not the only way to grow spiritually. The Twelve Steps show me how to bring my will into alignment with God's will. That is the direction in which I move. As my recovery progresses there is more of God, less of me. God is my home, and I have been moving homeward for years.</p><br> &nbsp;<br><br> <p>(c)2000. All rights reserved. Reprinted from <i>From the First Bite</i> by Kay Sheppard.

By eight o'clock I was in the M�tro heading for the Old Fort at Vincennes--the recruitment center of the Foreign Legion. There were few people about, and those who were had grim Monday-morning faces, probably reflecting my own.<br><br> From Vincennes station I walked through the streets and eventually arrived at the massive gates of the Old Fort. On a plaque on the wall there was a simple notice:<br> bureau d'engagement - l�gion �trang�re - ouvert jour et nuit.<br> I hammered on the huge doors, which swung open in response, and stepped into a cobbled courtyard to be confronted by the first legionnaire I had ever seen. He was dressed in khaki with a blue cummerbund around his waist and bright red epaulettes on his shoulders. He wore a white kepi on his head and had white gaiters, and I thought he looked quite impressive. I was less impressed with the archaic-looking rifle at his side. He slammed the great doors shut and beckoned me with his head to follow him.<br><br> I was ushered into a room on the door of which was inscribed bureau de semaine, which I assumed meant General Office or something similar. It was a primitive enough chamber with a bare plank floor and a wooden table and chair. One or two old and tired-looking photographs depicting legionnaires holding the regimental colors, men driving tanks through the desert, and others marching down the Champs-�lys�es hung limply on the wall.<br><br> A sergeant sitting behind the table looked me up and down but said nothing. I broke the ice and said in English that I had come to join the Foreign Legion, and he gave me a look that was a mixture of wonder and sympathy. He spoke reasonable English with a German accent and asked me "Why?"<br><br> I said something conventional about adventure and so on, and he said I had come to the wrong place. He said five years in the Legion would be long and hard, that I should forget the romantic idea that the English have of the Legion, and that I would do well to go away and reconsider the whole thing. I said I had given it a lot of thought and had come a long way, and eventually he said "Okay" with a sigh and led me upstairs and into an assembly hall.<br><br> As I walked into the hall, I was confronted with about forty people sitting on benches around the walls. Eighty eyes immediately focused on me, and my own swiveled round the room in a flash. There was not one single face on which my eyes could come to rest and l could say "He is like me" or "We are the same in some way." I knew instantly that I had not the slightest thing in common with any one of them.<br><br> I took an empty place at the end of one of the benches and contemplated my feet, but I could feel them all staring at me. They were an incredible mixture, dark, gray, white, brown, beards, moustaches, bald, and shaggy, wearing an unlimited array of different garments, but they all looked tough and unkempt and totally different from me. I was wishing to hell that I had worn a pair of jeans and an old pullover instead of a three-piece suit with a double-breasted waistcoat, of all things.<br><br> A couple of them were snickering on the other side of the room, and l kept my eyes averted although I could feel myself getting hot. We sat for a long time until at last an officer arrived with a couple of men in white coats, and we were told to strip down to underpants.<br><br> One by one we were called forward and given a series of medical tests. This took two hours, and after it was over we were again left sitting on our benches. The medical tests had loosened a few tongues, and people were chatting away to each other in different languages, mostly German. I kept to myself at this point and was wondering whether I would be in time to catch the six o'clock flight from Orly back to London.<br><br> An hour passed, and the officer reappeared accompanied by the sergeant who had been in the Bureau de Semaine. He made an announcement in French, from which I gathered that they had need of only seven of us and the rest could go. They read out seven names and mine was one of them.<br><br> The seven of us were called forward and led out of the room, leaving behind the rest who were being herded up for departure back into the welcome arms of Paris. We were taken along a series of dark passages and up several flights of stone stairs to a supply room at the top of the old building, where we were handed battledress and trousers, a pair of boots, and a greatcoat. Then we were given some food in a dingy little room that had metal tables and stools.<br><br> Nobody spoke a word during the meal, and when it was over we were ushered into a small room and made to listen to a tape recording, repeated in several languages. In the room there was a single naked forty-watt bulb dangling from the ceiling on a long cord, and the atmosphere was sinister. With me were two Germans, a Spaniard, a Belgian, and two Dutchmen. Everybody was tense.<br><br> The tape played in English, and I was informed that I was about to sign a five-year contract and that when l had signed there could be no turning back. The voice that came over the loudspeaker was solemn and had all the gloom of a judge pronouncing sentence of death. I wanted to talk to it, I wanted to talk to anybody who was English, but it was a one-way dialogue and it was decision-making time. We listened in silence and nobody said anything, nobody started shouting to get out, nobody cracked or lost their nerve or gave way to rising panic. Then we filed through into an office one at a time and signed the contract. It comprised three enormous tomes of unintelligible French. Attempts to read it were discouraged and would have been pointless, anyway.<br><br> I feel as though I have signed a blank check over to a complete stranger. Night has fallen and we are in a dormitory. Metal beds with straw-filled mattresses and a blanket. A bugle sounds "lights out" in the night, faint and loud against the mood of the wind. It is the end of my first day and the beginning of a new adventure. I think that the sergeant was right; it will be a long road and a lonely one. I am in the heart of Paris but it feels like the mountains of the moon.<br><br> The Next Day<br><br> We were awakened early with a bouncy bugle shattering cozy sleep, and after a cold-water rinse and a mug of coffee we were put to peeling potatoes, sweeping floors, and other general chores, called corv�e, around the fort. There is very little talk, primarily due to the language problem. The day passed quickly and tonight we are catching the train to Marseille. The journey begins.<br><br> 24 February 1960<br><br> There was trouble on the train last night and I have already made an enemy. There were not enough seats and it was first come, first served. During the evening I left the compartment for a pee and returned to find that the Spaniard had pinched my seat. I didn't like this situation at all. I tried very slowly to get across to him that he was in my seat and reading my magazine, but he affected deafness. It was early days to be getting into fights, but it was even earlier to be running away from them, and I knew quite suddenly that I would have to make a stand.<br><br> In one move, before I had time to talk myself out of it, I grabbed him by the lapels, yanked him to his feet, and threw him the length of the carriage.<br><br> We were both quite surprised: he by being thrown so violently and me by throwing him. I am quite small and am not used to throwing people about!<br><br> However, his surprise quickly gave in to other emotions, and he came charging at me. Our greatcoats and the lack of space hampered active movement, and neither of us got the better of the other, but I think I gave a good account of myself. Eventually the others in the carriage got bored with it and we were dragged apart. Public opinion came down on my side and the Spaniard was shoved out of the compartment back into the corridor. He went out with wild eyes glaring at me, screaming Spanish oaths and what were obviously threats of vengeance. I shall have to watch him.<br><br> We arrived in Marseille in midmorning and were driven in trucks to a fort overlooking the port. The fort is called Saint Nicolas. There are some three hundred Legion recruits here, and they arrive in batches of about thirty a day from the various recruitment centers at Strasbourg, Lyon, and Paris. About half are shipped to Algeria every ten days or so.<br><br> The first move was to issue us with denims in exchange for our battledress uniforms. The denims are dirty and torn, without buttons, held together with bits of string. Obviously the other gear was just for the train journey and for the benefit of the general public so that they would not feel they were traveling with convicts, because that is now what we look like.<br><br> The central courtyard of the fort looks exactly like the kind of prison compound that one sees in movies; groups cluster together looking furtive, others sit on the ground leaning against the wall, somehow everybody is whispering--or is it that I can't understand what they are saying? The NCOs look tough and they probably are. Why the hell do they look like prison wardens?<br><br> The atmosphere inside the barracks is cold and gloomy. The sanitary conditions are unbelievable. In a room that looks like an empty horse stable on a winter's morning, there is a solitary tap protruding from the wall, under which there is a sort of trough. The tap runs icy water, there is no window and no light, and this is the washroom for a hundred men. The lavatories are holes in the ground with footstands each side. Looks like a bad place for backache. In the dormitories the bunks are three-high, with the width of a man's body between them both vertically and horizontally. It reminds me of a concentration camp I once visited in Belgium that had been preserved as a macabre reminder of the Holocaust. The food by contrast is good, if you can get it. The emphasis is on first come, first served, and it is a self-service operation with no limits.<br><br> It is the evening and I am lying on my bunk with people all around. I am totally unnoticed, which is comforting. Card games are in progress around the tables in the center of the room; the whole place is a complete fog of smoke, and the sound is a perpetual jangle of different tongues jabbering in a million languages, none of which I understand.<br><br> Outside it's raining and the wind is blowing hard. Earlier this evening l walked along the battlements of the fort, which overlooks the harbor. One can see the Count of Monte Cristo's Chateau d'If, and I think I know how he felt. Strange sensations and emotions hit me as I looked at the beckoning lights of Marseille's nightlife. The boats idling on their moorings waiting for the summer sun looked tempting.<br><br> It seems impossible to believe that I have been here for only one day. I feel much more a prisoner than a soldier. I really have cut the old lifeline this time: This is a long way from home and a long way from anything I have ever known. To think, if things had gone the way they nearly did and fate had played a different card, I would probably have gone into the British army, been commissioned like my brother Anthony in the Scots Greys, and now be in a very different situation. I don't feel lonely but I feel cut off, totally disconnected from my own people. That's a bit frightening somehow. I could go down the plughole tomorrow and there's not a single person here who would turn a hair.<br><br> It's going to be a long time before I see my friends again, or drink a pint, or go to the National, or play cricket. Didsbury Cricket Club will be in a terrible state next weekend without me. Anyway, I suppose I'll get used to it. They say one gets used to anything in time. What the sages do not say is how much time.<br><br> Ten Days Later <br><br> Several days have gone quickly by. Each one begins at six o'clock with an assembly on the fort battlements. We stand in the cold in our thin denims and respond with a yell of "ici" when our names are called, and then we are dispatched in small groups on corv�e. I have been working at a sawmill for the last few days, during which it hasn't stopped raining--freezing hands fumbling with logs, soaking wet denims, blue with cold. Come on Africa!<br><br> 11 March 1960<br><br> There are a lot of Germans here, with Spaniards and Italians not far behind in numbers. The Italians spend much of their time buying and selling odds and ends or exchanging foreign currencies; God knows why, there's little enough money around. They are born brokers but light on credibility. I have struck up a talking relationship with an English-speaking Dutchman called Hank. He's in bad shape, having run off and left his wife after a family row and he's now regretting it. He has asked to be released, but it is doubtful if they will let him go because it would open the floodgates to all the others who must have changed their minds by now.<br><br> There is also an Australian swagman here, and it is good to have somebody who speaks more or less the same language. His name is Treers and three years in the merchant navy as a deckhand and several doses of clap are his chief claim to fame and the core of his conversation.<br><br> A Canadian called Gagnon arrived a couple of days after Treers, and he also claims to have had a long and distinguished career in the Canadian navy, but as an officer! Treers doesn't believe it--I can see why--and they are on a collision course. Gagnon is oily and unpleasant material. He brought with him two suitcases full of kit and ingratiated himself by distributing it among the parasites. The brokers could hardly believe their eyes.</p><h2>Our Babies, Ourselves: How Biology and Culture Shape the Way We Parent</h2><p>A thought-provoking combination of practical parenting information and scientific analysis,&nbsp;<i>Our Babies, Ourselves</i>&nbsp;is the first book to explore why we raise our children the way we do--and to suggest that we reconsider our culture's traditional views on parenting.<br><br>New parents are faced with innumerable decisions to make regarding the best way to care for their baby, and, naturally, they often turn for guidance to friends and family members who have already raised children. But as scientists are discovering, much of the trusted advice that has been passed down through generations needs to be carefully reexamined.<br><br>In this ground-breaking book, anthropologist Meredith Small reveals her remarkable findings in the new science of ethnopediatrics. Professor Small joins pediatricians, child-development researchers, and anthropologists across the country who are studying to what extent the way we parent our infants is based on biological needs and to what extent it is based on culture--and how sometimes what is culturally dictated may not be what's best for babies.<br><br>Should an infant be encouraged to sleep alone? Is breast-feeding better than bottle-feeding, or is that just a myth of the nineties? How much time should pass before a mother picks up her crying infant? And how important is it really to a baby's development to talk and sing to him or her?<br><br>These are but a few of the important questions Small addresses, and the answers not only are surprising, but may even change the way we raise our children.</p><p>How we raise our children differs greatly from society to society, with many cultures responding differently to such questions as how a parent should respond to a crying child, how often a baby should be nursed, and at what age a child should learn to sleep alone. Ethnopediatrics--the study of parents, children, and child rearing across cultures--is the subject of anthropologist Meredith F. Small's thorough and fascinating book <i>Our Babies, Ourselves</i>. <p> Small asserts that our ideas about how to raise our kids are as much a result of our culture as our biology, and that, in fact, many of the values we place on child-rearing practices are based in culture rather than biology. Small writes, "Every act by parents, every goal that molds that act, has a foundation in what is appropriate for that particular culture. In this sense, no parenting style is 'right' and no style is 'wrong.' It is appropriate or inappropriate only according to the culture." <i>Our Babies, Ourselves</i> is a wonderful read for anyone interested in the social sciences, and will be especially meaningful to those swept up in the wild adventure of parenting. <i>--Ericka Lutz</i></p>are faced with innumerable decisions to make regarding the best way to care for their baby, and, naturally, they often turn for guidance to friends and family members who have already raised children.

In this electrifying account Steven Gaines reveals the gothic tale of violence, addiction, greed, genius, madness, and rock 'n' roll behind the wholesome, surf-and-sun image. Through candid interviews with close friends, family, and the Beach Boys themselves, <i>Heroes and Villains</i> portrays and evaluates all those who propelled the California myth, and the group who sang about it, into worldwide prominence: Murry Wilson, the corrosive father who abused them as children and exploited them as adults; Dennis Wilson, who explored every avenue of excess (including welcoming the entire Manson family into his home) to his inevitable self-destruction; the Wilsons' cousin, frontman Mike Love, whose devotion to Eastern religion could not quell his violent temper; the wives (more than ten), mistresses, managers, and producers who consumed huge pieces of the "musical pie"; and of course, the band's artistic center, Brian Wilson, the mentally fragile musical genius who achieved so much and then so little. With dozens of photos, <i>Heroes and Villains</i> recounts the bitter saga of the American dream realized and distorted and the music that survived.</p><p><b>Steven Gaines</b> has written many books, including <i>Obsession: The Life and Times of Calvin Klein</i> and, as coauthor, <i>The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles</i>.The 25-year history of the Beach Boys has been one of triumph and tragedy. Starting out in 1961 with music that rode the California surfing craze to national popularity, the band projected a cleancut, all-American image. Their sudden success and later fall from popularity resulted in personal and group problems. By the early 1980s the Boys were surviving on nostalgia concert tours. Author Gaines, relying mostly on primary sources, has anecdotally captured all the infighting while dealing deftly with complex business details and treating the songs to thoughtful analysis. Although much of his information is not new (see John Milward's The Beach Boys Silver Anniversary , LJ 8/85) this presentation is vivid and compelling. Photos not seen. Paul G.

How easy was it to know what was actually going on, to grasp the essence of National Socialism, to remain untouched by the propaganda, or predict the Holocaust?</p><p><em>Travelers in the Third Reich</em> is an extraordinary history of the rise of the Nazis based on fascinating first-hand accounts, drawing together a multitude of voices and stories, including politicians, musicians, diplomats, schoolchildren, communists, scholars, athletes, poets, fascists, artists, tourists, and even celebrities like Charles Lindbergh and Samuel Beckett. Their experiences create a remarkable three-dimensional picture of Germany under Hitler&#x2015;one so palpable that the reader will feel, hear, even breathe the atmosphere.</p><p>These are the accidental eyewitnesses to history.

Previously a trustee of the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust, she now lives in London.&#x201c;While there have been countless books written about the rise of Hitler, <em>Travelers in the Third Reich</em> relies on firsthand accounts by foreigners to convey what it was really like to visit, study or vacation in Germany during the 1920s and &#x2019;30s. As Julia Boyd emphasizes, too many people allowed reverence for a nation&#x2019;s glorious past to warp their judgment about its morally repugnant present. That&#x2019;s a lesson still worth thinking about.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Michael Dirda, <em>The Washington Post</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Conveys how challenging it must have been to forecast the dimensions of the impending tragedy. Boyd notes that, in 1936, even so astute and well-intentioned an observer as the African-American educator W.E. B. DuBois &#x2015; who should have been particularly attuned to race-baiting and prejudice &#x2015; stopped short of demonizing the regime. Instead, in common with the European political leaders who failed to arrest Hitler&#x2019;s momentum, he temporized. &#x2018;It is extremely difficult,&#x2019; he wrote, &#x2018;to express an opinion about Germany today which is true in all respects without numerous modifications and explanations.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Boston Globe</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Far fewer travelers were free to move about the country during those years, and the accounts they left behind are, as Boyd puts it, &#x2018;both horrifying and touching.&#x2019; Those terms apply intensely to the whole of <em>Travelers in the Third Reich</em>, and readers will likely share Boyd's quiet outrage that more Germans didn't see &#x2013; or weren't willing to admit &#x2013; what was happening right in front of their eyes.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Christian Science Monitor</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;This fresh, surprising perspective on how Nazi Germany was seen at the time will appeal to anyone looking for a new angle on that historical moment.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A well-conceived study of a little-known corner of history.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Boyd's fresh and instructive look at 1930s Germany as described in contemporaneous travel narratives reveals a tourist destination that continued to attract visitors even as the true intentions of the Nazis became obvious.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Booklist</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Extraordinary and absorbing.

I was supposed to be out jogging, but instead I was sitting at my breakfast table talking about men, sex, werewolves, vampires, and that thing that most unmarried but sexually active women fear most... <br><br> Anita Blake needs to be concentrating on a dangerous situation: the ardeur, the sexual power that flows between Anita and Jean-Claude, Master Vampire of the City, and Richard, the volatile werewolf who loves her passionately, is reaching new levels, perhaps evolving into something altogether new. The ardeur seems to be choosing new lovers for Anita, acting with a will of its own. As Jean-Claude says, the ardeur is hunting powerful prey. The unexpected effect of this is that Jean-Claude's own power as a master vampire has grown to new levels -- and Richard, never predictable, is changing too. <br><br> But as the days pass, Anita's less interested in vampire politics than in an ancient, ordinary dread she shares with women down the ages: she may be pregnant. And, if she is, whether the father is a vampire, a werewolf, or someone else entirely, she knows perfectly well that being a Federal Marshall, known for raising the dead and being a vampire executioner, is no way to bring up a baby...<b>Laurell K.

So why is Navajo trickster, Magpie, trying to tell him a far more terrifying secret? Hungry for revenge, Ma&#x2019;iitsoh Dine&#x2019;, the Navajo Wolf, is out for blood. Summoning his darkest powers, the Witch of Ganado circles tribal investigator Charlie Yazzie&#x2019;s young son. Some may survive the witch&#x2019;s evil vendetta, but others will die to settle an old score. The unexpected happens when a woman from the past re-emerges to take control in this fast paced thriller critics now hail as the best yet of Chappell&#x2019;s sensational new southwestern mystery series. Critics describe R. Allen Chappell&#x2019;s writing as &#x201c;embedded and close to the ground&#x201d; with an intuitive knowledge of the Navajo people and their land.

I grew up with the Navajo, went to school with them, and later worked alongside them, forging enduring friendships along the way. Those friendships became the inspiration for this series. My writing focuses on the people of the Four Corners region, past, and present. I tend not to romanticize my characters, preferring instead to paint them as I find them.

Juan grew up in Mexico working in the fields to help provide for his family.

Melville House is rushing the report into print - including all its charts, graphs, and illustrations - to broadcast its meticulous and devastating findings about the causes and impact of global warming.</b><br><br>The U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) is mandated by law "at least every four years ... to submit to the President and the Congress an assessment regarding the findings of ... the effects of global change, and current and major long-term trends in global change." This year, the report was released in the wake of a series of some of the most devastating hurricanes in American history, as well as the horrific California wildfires. As the report says, "The assumption that current and future climate conditions will resemble the recent past is no longer valid."<br><br>Detailing not only the devastating impact of global warming on the environment, but health issues leading to tens of thousands of deaths per year, and economic losses of tens of billions of dollars, the report concludes that "The evidence of human-caused climate change is overwhelming and continues to strengthen, that the impacts of climate change are intensifying across the country, and that climate-related threats ... are rising."</p><p><b>The U.S. Global Change Research Program </b> (USGCRP) is a Federal program mandated by Congress to coordinate Federal research and investments in understanding the forces shaping the global environment, both human and natural, and their impacts on society.<p>Earth&#x2019;s climate is now changing faster than at any point in the history of modern civilization, primarily as a result of human activities. The impacts of global climate change are already being felt in the United States and are projected to intensify in the future&#x2014;but the severity of future impacts will depend largely on actions taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt to the changes that will occur. Americans increasingly recognize the risks climate change poses to their everyday lives and livelihoods and are beginning to respond (Figure 1.1). Water managers in the Colorado River Basin have mobilized users to conserve water in response to ongoing drought intensified by higher temperatures, and an extension program in Nebraska is helping ranchers reduce drought and heat risks to their operations. The state of Hawai&#x2019;i is developing management options to promote coral reef recovery from widespread bleaching events caused by warmer waters that threaten tourism, fisheries, and coastal protection from wind and waves. To address higher risks of flooding from heavy rainfall, local governments in southern Louisiana are pooling hazard reduction funds, and cities and states in the Northeast are investing in more resilient water, energy, and transportation infrastructure. In Alaska, a tribal health organization is developing adaptation strategies to address physical and mental health challenges driven by climate change and other environmental changes. As Midwestern farmers adopt new management strategies to reduce erosion and nutrient losses caused by heavier rains, forest managers in the Northwest are developing adaptation strategies in response to wildfire increases that affect human health, water resources, timber production, fish and wildlife, and recreation. After extensive hurricane damage fueled in part by a warmer atmosphere and warmer, higher seas, communities in Texas are considering ways to rebuild more resilient infrastructure. In the U.S. Caribbean, governments are developing new frameworks for storm recovery based on lessons learned from the 2017 hurricane season.</p><p>Climate-related risks will continue to grow without additional action. Decisions made today determine risk exposure for current and future generations and will either broaden or limit options to reduce the negative consequences of climate change. While Americans are responding in ways that can bolster resilience and improve livelihoods, neither global efforts to mitigate the causes of climate change nor regional efforts to adapt to the impacts currently approach the scales needed to avoid substantial damages to the U.S. economy, environment, and human health and well-being over the coming decades.</p></p><h2>Spice and Wolf, Vol. 4 - manga</h2><p>Proud of his skillful transaction in Poroson (with more than a little help from Holo), Lawrence turns his cart toward Ruvinheigen in hopes of swelling his profits.

Carolyn Campbell&#x2019;s evocative images are complemented by those of renowned landscape photographer Joe Cornish. &#x201c;City of Immortals&#x201d; celebrates the novelty and eccentricity of P�re-Lachaise Cemetery through the engrossing story of the history of the site established by Napoleonic decree along with portraits of the last moments of the cultural icons buried within its walls. In addition to several &#x201c;conversations&#x201d; with some of the high-profile residents, three guided tours are provided along with an illustrated pull-out map featuring the grave sites of eighty-four architects, artists, writers, musicians, dancers, filmmakers and actors, including Oscar Wilde, Jim Morrison of the Doors. Fr�d�ric Chopin, Georges Bizet, Edith Piaf, Maria Callas, Isadora Duncan, Eug�ne Delacroix, Gertrude Stein, Amedeo Modigliani, Sarah Bernhardt, Simone Signoret, Colette and Marcel Proust.</p><p>Carolyn Campbell was born in Washington, DC, has lived in Paris, and is now a resident of Los Angeles. A published writer and an exhibited photographer, her fascination with P�re-Lachaise was kindled on a first visit to Paris in 1981. With the support and encouragement of her mentor, John Russell--the late New York Times art critic--she embarked on her research and photo documentation of the cemetery. A summa cum laude graduate of the Maryland Institute College of Art, she has been working as an arts and communications specialist for over thirty years. She has held executive positions with the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the American Film Institute, and the UCLA School of the Arts and Architecture, where she was also editor of UCLA Arts magazine.<br><br>Joe Cornish is based in the U.K. and has shot travel, cultural, and landscape subjects for thirty-six years. Since his first photographic explorations in P�re-Lachaise with Carolyn Campbell in 1982, he has contributed to numerous travel books as well as writing his own on landscape photography. An Honorary Fellow of the Royal Photographic Society (RPS), he is now Chair of the RPS Fellowship Board.&#x201c;In City of Immortals, Carolyn Campbell gives readers three books in one; a personal dialogue with the immortals, a scholarly history of funerary architecture and design, and an intimate tour of the world&#x2019;s most famous cemetery.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;City of Immortals is not only beautiful but helpful. P�re-Lachaise is the final resting place of Sarah Bernhardt, Fr�d�ric Chopin, Eug�ne Delacroix, Edith Piaf, Marcel Proust, Gertrude Stein, Isadora Duncan, Oscar Wilde and, somehow most famously, Jim Morrison. It&#x2019;s a great place to visit&#x2015;but a tough place to find your way around. Though, as Campbell is quick to point out, &#x2018;Sometimes getting lost can be as rewarding as arriving at your intended destination.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The artist&#x2019;s voluminous work is a gorgeous collection of words and images that captures the awe of the place, its legacy, its grace, its sense of peace and mystery.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It is indispensable for anyone who wants to truly get their mind around this amazing maze of art and death. Thankfully, a passionate American has set her laser focus on these 107-acres of corpses and copses.&#x201d;</p><h2>How to Connect with Your Troubled Adult Children: Effective Strategies for Families in Pain</h2><p><p><b>What to Do When Parenting Gets Painfully Complicated</b><br><br> Are your adult child&#x2019;s mental, emotional, and physical health issues driving you to despair?

On ships shaped like dragons, bristling with oars and armor, Jarl Sigurd and his fierce Norsemen have come in search of riches. And riches they are promised, by an English ruler who sends Sigurd and his wolves to steal a holy manuscript from another kingdom. Osric, an orphan boy, sees beyond the terror of these warriors, and somehow knows the heathens&#x2019; tongue. Renamed Raven, rechristened in blood, he will join them. They are his people.

The lean days of fasting and the long months of winter had been forgotten with the full bellies of the Easter feast. The people were busy with the outdoor tasks that the icy winds had kept them from: straightening loose thatch, replacing rotten fences, replenishing wood stores, and stirring new life into the rich soil of the plow fields. Wild garlic smothered the earth in the shady woods like a white pelt, its scent whipped up by the breeze, and blue spring squill sat like a low mist upon the grassy slopes and headlands, stirred by the salty sea air.<br><br>Usually I was woken by Ealhstan&#x2019;s mutterings and one of his bony fingers digging into my ribs, but on this day I rose before the old man, hoping to be away catching a fish for our breakfast before having to suffer his ill temper. I even imagined he might be pleased with me for being at the task before the sun reddened the eastern horizon, though it was more likely he would begrudge my being awake before him. Fishing rod in hand and wrapped in a threadbare cloak, I stepped out into the predawn stillness and shivered with a yawn that brought water to my eyes.<br><br>&#x201c;The old goat got you working by the light of the stars now, has he?&#x201d; came a low voice, and I turned to make out Griffin the warrior leading his great gray hunting dog by a rope that was knotted so that the animal choked itself as it fought him. &#x201c;Keep still, boy!&#x201d; Griffin growled, yanking the rope viciously. The beast was coughing, and I thought Griffin might break its neck if it did not stop pulling.<br><br>&#x201c;You know Ealhstan,&#x201d; I said, holding back my hair and leaning over the rain barrel. &#x201c;He can&#x2019;t take a piss before he&#x2019;s had his breakfast.&#x201d; I thrust my face into the dark, cold water and held it there, then came up and shook my head, wiping my eyes on the back of my arm.<br><br>Griffin looked down at the dog, which was beaten at last and stood with its head slumped low between its shoulders, looking up at its master pathetically. &#x201c;Found the dumb bastard sniffing around Siward&#x2019;s place just now. He ran off yesterday. First time I&#x2019;ve laid eyes on him since.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Siward&#x2019;s got a bitch in heat,&#x201d; I said, tying back my hair.<br><br>&#x201c;So the wife tells me,&#x201d; Griffin said, a smile touching his mouth. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t blame him, I suppose. We all want a bit of what&#x2019;s good for us, hey, boy?&#x201d; he added, rubbing the dog&#x2019;s head roughly. I liked Griffin. He was a hard man but had no hatred in him like the others. Or perhaps it was fear he lacked.<br><br>&#x201c;Some things in life are certain, Griffin,&#x201d; I said, returning his smile. &#x201c;Dogs will chase bitches, and Ealhstan will eat mackerel every morning till his old teeth fall out.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, you&#x2019;d better dip that line, lad,&#x201d; he warned, nodding southward toward the sea. &#x201c;Even Arsebiter here has less bite than old Ealhstan. I wouldn&#x2019;t get on the wrong side of that tongueless bastard for every mackerel the Lord Jesus and His disciples pulled out of the Red Sea.&#x201d;<br><br>I looked back to the house. &#x201c;Ealhstan doesn&#x2019;t have a right side,&#x201d; I said in a low voice. Griffin grinned, bending to rub Arsebiter&#x2019;s muzzle. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bring you a codfish one of these days, Griffin. Long as your arm,&#x201d; I said, shivering again, and then we parted ways, he toward his house and me toward the low sound of the sea.<br><br>A pinkish glow lay across the eastern horizon, but the sun was still concealed and it was dark as I climbed the hill that shielded Abbotsend from the worst of the weather blowing in from the gray sea. But I had walked the path many times and had no need of a flame. Besides, the old crumbling watchtower stood visible at the hilltop as a black shape against a dark purple sky. Folk said it was built by the Romans, that long-�disappeared race. I did not know if that was true, but I whispered thanks to them anyway, for with the tower in sight I could not lose my way.<br><br>My mind wandered, though, as I considered taking a skiff beyond the sea-�battered rocks the next morning to try to catch something other than mackerel. You could pull in a great codfish if you could get your hook to the seabed. Suddenly, a metallic tock stopped me dead and something whipped my eyes, for an instant blinding me. I dropped to one knee, feeling the hairs spring up on the back of my neck. A guttural croak broke the stillness, and I saw a black shape swoop up, then plunge, settling on the tower&#x2019;s crumbling crown. It croaked again, and even in the weak dawn light its wings glinted with a purple sheen as its stout beak stabbed at its feathers. I had seen similar birds many times&#x2014;�clouds of crows that swept down to the fields to dig for seeds or worms&#x2014;�but this was a huge raven, and the sight of it was enough to freeze my blood.<br><br>&#x201c;Away with you, bird,&#x201d; I said, picking up a small piece of red brick and throwing it at the creature. I missed, but it was enough to send the raven flapping noisily into the sky, a black smear against the lightening heavens. &#x201c;So you&#x2019;re scared of birds now, Osric?&#x201d; I muttered, shaking my head as I crested the hill and made my way through stalks of pink thrift and cushioning sea campion down to the shore. A damp mist had been thrown up to blanket the dunes and shingle, and a flock of screeching gulls passed overhead, tumbling down into the murk, leaving behind them a wake of noise. I jumped across three rock pools full of green weed, the small bladders floating at the surface, then onto my fishing rock, where I knocked a limpet into the sea with the butt of my rod before unwinding the line.<br><br>After the time it takes to put a keen edge on a knife, nothing had taken the hook, and I thought about �trying another spot where I had once pulled in a rough-�skinned fish as long as my leg with wicked, sharp teeth. It was then that I caught a strange sound amid the rhythmic breathing of the surf. I wedged the rod in a crevice, the line still in the sea, and scrambled higher up the rocks above the shingle. But I saw nothing other than the sea-�stirred vapor, which seemed alive, like some strange beast writhing before me, concealing and revealing the ocean time and again. I heard only the shrieks of white gulls and the breaking waves and was about to jump down when I heard the strange sound again.<br><br>This time I froze like an icicle. My muscles gripped my bones rigid. The breath caught fast in my chest, and cold fear crept up my spine, prickling my scalp. The thin hollow note of a horn sounded again, and then came the rhythmic slap of oars. As if conjured from the spirit world, a dragon emerged, a wooden beast with a belly of clinkered strakes that flowed up into its slender neck. The monster&#x2019;s head was set with faded red eyes, and I wanted to run but was stuck to the rock like the limpets, fixed by the stare of a great bearded warrior who stood with one arm around the monster&#x2019;s neck. His beard parted, revealing a malicious smile, then the boat&#x2019;s keel scraped up the shingle with a noise like thunder, and men were jumping from the ship, sliding on the wet rocks and falling and splashing into the surf. Guttural voices echoed off the rocks behind me, and my bowels melted. Another dragon ship must have beached farther down the shore beyond Hermit&#x2019;s Rock. Men with swords and axes and round painted shields stepped from the mist, their war gear clinking noisily to shatter the �unnatural stillness. They gathered around me like wolves, pointing east and west, their hard voices rousing shrieks from gulls overhead. I mumbled a prayer to Christ and His saints that my death would be quick as the warrior from the ship&#x2019;s prow stepped up and grabbed my throat. He shoved me at another heathen, who gripped my shoulder with a powerful hand. This one wore a green cloak fastened with a silver brooch in the shape of a wolf&#x2019;s head. I saw the iron rings of a mail shirt, a brynja, beneath the cloak, and I retched.<br><br>Now, after all these years, I might essay a few untruths. I doubt any still live who could prove my words false. I could say that I stuck out my chest and took a grip on my fear. That I did not piss myself. But who would believe me? These outlanders leaping from their dragons were armed and fierce. They were warriors and grown men. And I was just a boy. A strange and frightening magic fell across me then. The outlanders&#x2019; sharp language began to change, seemed to melt, the percussive clipped grunts becoming a stream of sounds that were somehow familiar. I swallowed some of the fear, my tongue beginning to move over those noises like water over pebbles, awakening to them, and I heard myself repeating them until they became no longer just noises but words. And I understood them.<br><br>&#x201c;But look at his eye, Uncle!&#x201d; the man with the wolf brooch said. &#x201c;He is marked. �din god of war has given him a clot of blood for an eye. On my oath, I feel the All-�Father breathing down my neck.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I agree with Sigurd,&#x201d; another said, his eyes slits of suspicion. &#x201c;The way he appeared in the mist was not natural. You all saw it. The vapor became flesh! Any normal man would have run from her.&#x201d; He pointed to the ship with its carved dragon&#x2019;s head. &#x201c;But this one stood here as if he was . . . as if he was waiting for us. I want no part in his death, Sigurd,&#x201d; he finished, shaking his head.<br><br>I prayed they would not see the fishing rod in the crack in the rock, and I hoped the mackerel were still asleep, for mackerel fight like devils and if one took my hook, the line would jump and the heathens would see me for what I was.<br><br>&#x201c;I can help you,&#x201d; I spluttered, buoyed suddenly by the hope that the outlanders were lost, blown off course on the way to who knew where.</p><h2>Reflections on a Gift of Watermelon Pickle</h2><p>Here are modern poems chosen for their individual excellence and their special appeal to young people.

The dog is a Labrador-Newfoundland mix. Tom says he looks like a Labrador with a bad perm. He wanted to name the dog "Put Your Shirt On" (please don't ask why), but he was outvoted by his family. The dog's name is Shadow. Early in his career Tom worked in politics, including a stint as the chief speechwriter for the governor of Ohio. This experience helped him develop the unique, storytelling narrative style of the Stick Dog books. More important, Tom's time in politics made him realize a very important thing: Kids are way smarter than adults. And it's a lot more fun and rewarding to write stories for them than to write speeches for grown-ups.</p></p><h2>Brain Training for Runners: A Revolutionary New Training System to Improve Endurance, Speed, Health, and Res ults</h2><p><b>Based on new research in exercise physiology, author and running expert Matt Fitzgerald introduces a first-of-its-kind training strategy that he's named "Brain Training." <br><br></b>Runners of all ages, backgrounds, and skill levels can learn to maximize their performance by supplying the brain with the right feedback.

I'd known enough writers, even at that age, to see that what happens to your work is so far out of your control you simply can't afford to let that kind of concern enter your thinking. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> The publisher asked you to remove four chapters from the book. At the time, did you agree with the decision? Have your feelings about it changed over the years? </p><p> <strong>Beagle:</strong> At the time I was outraged. I fought every step of the way, and every sentence. Today I'm inordinately grateful to Marshall Best, the editor who did that. Marshall is long gone, so I just hope that back then I had sense and courtesy enough to say thank you. But I don't think I realized fully what his effect on the book had been until many years later. If it weren&#x2019;t for him I don&#x2019;t think the book would still be in print. He's also the one who came up with the title and the allusion to those marvelously appropriate lines from Andrew Marvell's "To His Coy Mistress"--I'd originally called the book <i>The Dark City</i>, after the way that Jonathan Rebeck saw the graveyard. Titles, sad to say, have never been my strong suit. Most of my best have actually come from friends or editors. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> To what extent are any of the characters in <i>A Fine and Private Place</i> autobiographical? I ask because the detail work in the novel, especially with regard to older people, seems so fresh and free of cliche. </p><p> <strong>Beagle:</strong> I think that <i>A Fine and Private Place</i> is very nearly, though not quite, my first attempt to capture the voices in the Bronx neighborhood where I grew up. Nobody is based on any one person, but there&#x2019;s a piece here and a piece there was useful. I hung fire on creating Laura Durant, when it came time to bring her into the story, until I decided to base her physically--not emotionally, but physically--on a Pittsburgh actress I was in a play with. I just didn't know enough young women in those days. And there are scenes in there which people from the old neighborhood would recognize--when Mrs. Klapper goes into the Wireman's grocery, that is very much the little store on the corner across from my house. Yet even there I mixed things up. I think what keeps the book fresh isn't the fantasy, but the fact that I was trying very hard to make it real. To make the voices real. In the end it is always the voices, for me. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Your books have, over the years, resonated with readers everywhere. Have reader reactions or opinions changed the way you think of the books? </p><p> <strong>Beagle:</strong> Only in the sense that they sometimes make me go back and look at them. When you do this writing thing day by day, you don't do a lot of reflecting on your own relationship to the old work. What does get me, though, is just how much the books have actually influenced the real lives of real people in ways I couldn't imagine. That&#x2019;s enormously touching for me. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> One of my favorite moments in your fiction is when the true Medieval infringes on the fake Medieval in <i>The Folk of the Air</i>. You manage to convey a real sense of the alien perspective--a sense that if we were to travel back in time, we might find our ancestors as hard to understand as we would creatures from outer space. Did you research your way into that moment and that effect, or...? </p><p> <strong>Beagle:</strong> I've thought about it a lot, having read a great deal of history (my father was a history teacher). And there are fiction writers out there who are so good at bringing the literal stink of a certain period into your nostrils as you read...well, for me they are intimidating, because there are novels I'd like to write based on certain historical events that I'm just not sure I could. In the case of <i>The Folk of the Air</i> I did a lot of research, from many angles, because the real group that my imaginary one was based on didn't limit itself to a narrow span of time, but rather built characters and personas out of events as far back as the Viking era and as recent as 1650. And the history as presented in their gatherings wasn't necessarily the most accurate. So on the one hand I was trying to go for a certain sense of the real, when it does come, in contrast to some fanciful, semi-informed imaginings. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> What are you currently working on--and where should we look for your short fiction in the next year or so? </p><p> <strong>Beagle:</strong> In terms of short fiction, I've got a chapbook coming out from Dreamhaven Books early in 2008 called <i>Strange Roads</i>, with three stories inspired by the art of Lisa Snellings-Clark. There are also six or eight pieces of short fiction appearing in various original fantasy anthologies, magazines, and fiction websites, and I'm working on a quartet of season-themed stories that will premiere not in print, but as podcasts. That last set is for a wonderful little website called The Green Man Review. They did a whole special issue about me and also named me their official Oak King this year, so it's the least I could do. In terms of book-length work, 2008 is going to be absolutely crazy with original books and reprints. Just crazy. There are a couple of new novels finally coming out, a manga-style graphic adaptation of <i>The Last Unicorn</i>, several new collections, and at least two nonfiction books. I can hardly keep track of it all myself, so the best way for anyone to stay up to date would be to visit my website or Conlan Press, or just sign up for my free email newsletter, <i>The Raven</i>. Whatever else I might think about being 68, the simple fact is that I'm busier than ever. It's like George Burns used to say: "I can't die--I'm booked!" </p>Peter S. Beagle is the best-selling author of <i>The Last Unicorn</i>, which has sold a reported five million copies since its initial publication in 1968. His other novels include <i>A Fine &amp; Private Place</i>, <i>The Innkeeper&#x2019;s Song</i>, and <i>Tamsin</i>. His short fiction has been collected in four volumes by Tachyon Publications, including <i>The Rhinoceros Who Quoted Nietzsche</i>, <i>The Line Between</i>, <i>We Never Talk About My Brother</i>, and <i>Sleight of Hand</i>. He has won the Hugo, Nebula, Mythopoeic, and Grand Prix de l&#x2019;Imaginaire awards as well as the World Fantasy Award for Lifetime Achievement.</p><h2>Whose Boat Is This Boat?: Comments That Don&#39;t Help in the Aftermath of a Hurricane</h2><p><b>100% of <i>The Late Show</i>&#x2019;s proceeds from this book go to disaster relief.</b><br><br><i>Whose Boat Is This Boat?
